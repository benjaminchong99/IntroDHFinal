__Title__ What I'Ve Done By Linkin Park

In this farewell
 There's no blood
 There's no alibi
 Cause I've drawn regret
 From the truth
 Of a thousand lies
 So let mercy come
 And wash away
 What I've done
 I'll face myself
 To cross out what I've become
 Erase myself
 And let go of what I've done
 Put to rest
 What you thought of me
 While I clean this slate
 With the hands
 Of uncertainty
 So let mercy come
 And wash away
 What I've done
 I'll face myself
 To cross out what I've become
 Erase myself
 And let go of what I've done
 For what I've done
 I start again
 And whatever pain may come
 Today this ends
 I'm forgiving what I've done
 I'll face myself
 To cross out what I've become
 Erase myself
 And let go of what I've done
 What I've done
   
   
 Forgiving what I've done
   
 
__Title__ Can'T Stop By Red Hot Chili Peppers

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
 Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
 Choose not a life of imitation
 Distant cousin to the reservation
 Defunct the pistol that you pay for
 This punk, the feeling that you stay for
 In time I want to be your best friend
 East side lovers living on the west end
 Knocked out but boy you better come to
 Don't die, you know the truth as some do
 Go write your message on the pavement
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
 White heat is screaming in the jungle
 Complete the motion if you stumble
 Go ask the dust for any answers
 Come back strong with fifty belly dancers
 The world I love
 The tears I drop
 To be part of
 The wave, can't stop
 Ever wonder if it's all for you
 The world I love
 The trains I hop
 To be part of
 The wave, can't stop
 Come and tell me when it's time to
 Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
 So smart, she's leading me to ozone
 Music the great communicator
 Use two sticks to make it in the nature
 I'll get you into penetration
 The gender of a generation
 The birth of every other nation
 Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
 This chapter's going to be a close one
 Smoke rings, I know your going to blow one
 All on a spaceship persevering
 Use my hands for everything but steering
 Can't stop the spirits when they need you
 Mop tops are happy when they feed you
 J
 Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
 The world I love
 The tears I drop
 To be part of
 The wave, can't stop
 Ever wonder if it's all for you
 The world I love
 The trains I hop
 To be part of
 The wave, can't stop
 Come and tell me when it's time to
 Wait a minute I'm passing out
 Win or lose, just like you
 Far more shocking
 Than anything I ever knew
 How about you
 Ten more reasons
 Why I need somebody new just like you
 Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
 Right on cue
 Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
 Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
 Choose not a life of imitation
 Distant cousin to the reservation
 Defunct the pistol that you pay for
 This punk, the feeling that you stay for
 In time I want to be your best friend
 East side lovers living on the west end
 Knocked out but boy, you better come to
 Don't die you know the truth as some do
 Go write your message on the pavement
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
 Kick start the golden generator
 Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
 Can't stop the gods from engineering
 Feel no need for any interfering
 Your image in the dictionary
 This life is more than ordinary
 Can I get two, maybe even three of these
 Coming from space
 To teach you of the Pleiades
 Can't stop the spirits when they need you
 This life is more than just a read through
 
__Title__ Boulevard Of Broken Dreams By Green Day

I walk a lonely road
 The only one that I have ever known
 Don't know where it goes
 But it's home to me, and I walk alone
 I walk this empty street
 On the boulevard of broken dreams
 Where the city sleeps
 And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk a
 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 'Til then I walk alone
 I'm walking down the line
 That divides me somewhere in my mind
 On the border line
 Of the edge and where I walk alone
 Read between the lines
 Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
 And I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk a
 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 'Til then I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk a
 I walk this empty street
 On the boulevard of broken dreams
 Where the city sleeps
 And I'm the only one and I walk a
 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 'Til then I walk alone
 
__Title__ Hysteria By Muse

It's bugging me, grating me
 And twisting me around
 Yeah, I'm endlessly caving in
 And turning inside out
 'Cause I want it now, I want it now
 Give me your heart and your soul
 And I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
 Last chance to lose control
 It's holding me, morphing me
 And forcing me to strive
 To be endlessly cold within
 And dreaming I'm alive
 'Cause I want it now, I want it now
 Give me your heart and your soul
 I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
 Last chance to lose control
 And I want you now, I want you now
 I'll feel my heart implode
 And I'm breaking out, escaping now
 Feeling my faith erode
 
__Title__ Seven Nation Army By The White Stripes

I'm gonna fight 'em off
 A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
 They're gonna rip it off
 Taking their time right behind my back
 And I'm talking to myself at night
 Because I can't forget
 Back and forth through my mind
 Behind a cigarette
 And a message coming from my eyes
 Says leave it alone
 Don't wanna hear about it
 Every single one's got a story to tell
 Everyone knows about it
 From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell
 And if I catch you coming back my way
 I'm gonna sell it to you
 And that ain't what you want to hear
 But that's what I'll do
 And a feeling coming from my bones
 Says find a home
 I'm going to Wichita
 Far from this opera forevermore
 I'm gonna work the straw
 Make the sweat drip out of every pore
 And I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding
 And I'm bleeding right before the Lord
 All the words are gonna bleed from me
 And I will think no more
 And the stains coming from my blood
 Tell me go back home
 
__Title__ How You Remind Me By Nickelback

Never made it as a wise man
 I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
 Tired of livin' like a blind man

 Been to the bottom of every bottle

 Scream, 
 Yet, yet, yet, no no

__Title__ Kryptonite By 3 Doors Down

I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
 I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
 But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
 I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
 I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
 After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
 I really don't mind what happens now and then

 If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
 If I'm alive and well, will you be there a

 But still your secrets I will keep
 You took for granted all the times

 You stumbled in and bumped your head
 If not for me then you'd be dead
 I picked you up and put you back
 On solid ground
 If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman

Am I more than you bargained for yet
 I've been dyin' to tell you anything you want to hear
 'Cause that's just who I am this week
 Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
 I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
 And drop a heart and break a name

 Wishing to be the friction in your jeans

I'm in the business of misery
 let's take it from the top
 She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
 It's a matter of time before we all run out
 When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
 I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
 I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
 Two weeks and we had caught on fire
 She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But, God, does it feel so good
 Cause I got him where I want him now
 And if you could, then you know you would
 Cause, God, it just feels so
 It just feels so good
 Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
 Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
 And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
 I'm sorry, honey, but I'm past that, now look this way
 Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
 Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
 They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
 Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But, God, does it feel so good
 Cause I got him where I want him right now
 And if you could, then you know you would
 Cause, God, it just feels so
 It just feels so good
 I watched his wildest dreams come true
 Not one of them involving you
 Just watch my wildest dreams come true
 Not one of them involving
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, I never meant to brag

Hear the sound of the falling rain
 Coming down like an Armageddon flame
 The shame
 The ones who died without a name
 Hear the dogs howling out of key
 To a hymn called Faith and Misery 
 And bleed, the company lost the war today!
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
 On Holiday!
 Hear the drum pounding out of time
 Another protestor has crossed the line 
 To find, the money's on the other side
 Can I get another Amen
 There's a flag wrapped around a score of men 
 A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
 This is the dawning of the rest our lives
 On Holiday!
 Zieg Heil to the president gasman
 Bombs away is your punishment
 Pulverize the Eiffel towers
 Who critiscize your government
 Bang bang goes the broken glass and
 Kill all the fags that don't agree
 Trials by fire, setting fire
 Is not a way that's meant for me
 Just cause, just cause because we're outlaws yeah!
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
 This is our lives on holiday!
 
__Title__ Last Resort By Papa Roach

Cut my life into pieces
 This is my last resort
 Suffocation, no breathing
 Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
 This is my last resort
 Cut my life into pieces
 I've reached my last resort
 Suffocation, no breathing
 Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
 Do you even care if I die bleeding
 Would it be wrong, would it be right
 If I took my life tonight
 Chances are that I might
 Mutilation out of sight
 And I'm contemplating suicide
 'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 I never realized I was spread too thin
 Till it was too late and I was empty within
 Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin
 Downward spiral, where do I begin
 It all started when I lost my mother
 No love for myself and no love for another
 Searching to find a love upon a higher level
 Finding nothing but questions and devils
 'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
 I'm running and I'm crying
 I'm crying, I'm crying
 I'm crying, I'm crying
 I can't go on living this way
 Cut my life into pieces
 This is my last resort
 Suffocation, no breathing
 Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
 Would it be wrong, would it be right
 If I took my life tonight
 Chances are that I might
 Mutilation out of sight
 And I'm contemplating suicide
 'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
 I'm running and I'm crying
 I can't go on living this way
 Can't go on living this way
 Nothing's all right
 
__Title__ In The End By Linkin Park

It starts with one
 One thing,
 I don't know why
 It doesn't even matter how hard you'd try
 Keep that in mind
 I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 All i know
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down 'till the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 It's so unreal
 You didn't look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on, to didn't even know
 I wasted it all just to
 Watch you go
 I kept everything inside
 And even though i tried,
 It all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually
 Be a memory of a time when
 I've tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end,
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end,
 It doesn't even matter
 One thing, i don't know why
 It doesn't even matter how hard you'd try
 Keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
 To remind myself how
 I've tried so hard
 In spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like i was part of your property
 Remembering all the times you fought with me
 I'm surprised, it
 Got so far
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
 Not that you wouldn't knew me, back then
 But it all comes back to me
 In the end
 You kept everything inside
 And even though i tried,
 It all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually
 Be a memory
 Of a time when
 I've tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end,
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end,
 It doesn't even matter
 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as i can go
 For all this
 There's only one thing you should've know
 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as i can go
 For all this
 There's only one thing you should've know
 I've tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end,
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end,
 It doesn't even matter
 
__Title__ Teenagers By My Chemical Romance

They're gonna clean up your looks
 With all the lies in the books
 To make a citizen out of you
 Because they sleep with a gun
 And keep an eye on you, son
 So they can watch all the things you do
 Because the drugs never work
 They're gonna give you a smirk
 'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
 They're gonna rip up your heads
 Your aspirations to shreds
 Another cog in the murder machine
 They said all
 Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
 They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
 So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
 The boys and girls in the clique
 The awful names that they stick
 You're never gonna fit in much, kid
 But if you're troubled and hurt
 What you got under your shirt
 We'll make them pay for the things that they did
 They said all
 Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
 They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
 So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
 They said all

 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
 All together now!

 They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
 So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

__Title__ Californication By Red Hot Chili Peppers

Psychic spies from China
 Try to steal your mind's elation
 Little girls from Sweden
 Dream of silver screen quotations
 And if you want these kind of dreams
 It's Californication
 It's the edge of the world
 And all the western civilization
 The sun may rise in the east
 At least it settled in the finer location
 It's understood that Hollywood
 Sells Californication
 Pay your surgeon very well
 To break the spell of aging
 Celebrity skin, is this your chin
 Or is that war you're waging
 First born in a corn
 Hard core soft porn
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world
 Be my very own constellation
 A teenage bride with a baby inside
 Getting high on information
 And buy me a star on the boulevard
 It's Californication
 Space may be the final frontier
 But it's made in a Hollywood basement
 And Cobain, can you hear the spheres
 Singing songs of station to station
 And Alderon's, my faraway
 It's Californication
 Born and raised by those who praise
 Control of population
 And everybody's been there
 And I don't mean on vacation
 First born in a corn
 Hard core soft porn
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Destruction leads to a very rough road
 But it also breeds creation
 And earthquakes out to a girl's guitar
 They're just another good vibration
 And tidal waves couldn't save the world
 From Californication
 Pay your surgeon very well
 To break the spell of aging
 Sicker than the rest, there is no test
 But this is what you're craving
 First born in a corn
 Hard core soft porn
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication

Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
 And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
 Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
 And as you step back in the line a mob jumps to their feet
 Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
 And no one even knew, it was really only you
 And now you steal away
 Take him out today
 Nice work you did
 You're gonna go far, kid
 With a thousand lies and a good disguise
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives
 Slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sights
 So play it out I'm wide awake, it's a scene about me
 There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay

 Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
 And no one even knew, it was really only you
 And now you'll lead the way
 Show the light of day
 Nice work you did
 You're gonna go far, kid

 And no one even knew, it was really only you
 So dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
 It was really only you
 With a thousand lies and a good disguise
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives
 Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives

Conversion, software version 7
 Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
 Eating seeds as a past time activity
 The toxicity of our city, of our city
 New, what do you own the world
 How do you own disorder, disorder
 Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
 Sacred silence and sleep
 Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
 Disorder, disorder, disorder
 More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
 Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
 Eating seeds as a past time activity
 The toxicity of our city, of our city
 New, what do you own the world
 How do you own disorder, disorder
 Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
 Sacred silence and sleep
 Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
 Disorder, disorder, disorder
 New, what do you own the world
 How do you own disorder, disorder
 Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
 Sacred silence and sleep
 Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
 Disorder, disorder, disorder
 When I became the sun
 I shone life into the man's hearts
 When I became the sun
 I shone life into the man's hearts

What if I wanted to break
 Laugh it all off in your face
 What would you do
 What if I fell to the floor
 Couldn't take all this anymore
 What would you do, do, do
 Come, break me down
 Bury me, bury me
 I am finished with you
 What if I wanted to fight
 Beg for the rest of my life
 What would you do
 You say you wanted more
 What are you waiting for
 I'm not running from you
 Come, break me down
 Bury me, bury me
 I am finished with you
 Look in my eyes
 You're killing me, killing me
 All I wanted was you
 I tried to be someone else
 But nothing seemed to change
 I know now, this is who I really am inside
 Finally found myself
 Fighting for a chance
 I know now, this is who I really am
 Come, break me down
 Bury me, bury me
 I am finished with you, you, you
 Look in my eyes
 You're killing me, killing me
 All I wanted was you
 Come, break me down
 Break me down
 Break me down
 What if I wanted to break
 What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I
 Bury me, bury me

She says she's no good
 With words but I'm worse
 Barely stuttered out 
 Stuck to my tongue
 Weighed down with words too
 Over
 Tonight it's 
 Versus 
 I'm two quarters and a heart down
 And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
 These words are all I have so I'll write them
 So you need them just to get by
 Dance, dance
 We're falling apart to half time
 Dance, dance
 And these are the lives you love to lead
 Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
 How misery loved me
 You always fold just
 Before you're found out
 Drink up, it's last call, last resort
 But only the first mistake and
 I'm two quarters and a heart down
 And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
 These words are all I have so I'll write them
 So you need them just to get by
 Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
 You've been saving for his mattress, love
 Dance, dance
 We're falling apart to half time
 Dance, dance
 And these are the lives you love to lead
 Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
 How misery loved me
 Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
 You've been saving for his mattress 
 I only want sympathy in the form of you
 Crawling into bed with me
 Dance, dance
 We're falling apart to half time
 Dance, dance
 And these are the lives you'd love to lead
 Dance, this is the way they'd love 
 Dance, this is the way they'd love 
 Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
 How misery loved me
 Dance, dance

 Just try your best, try everything you can
 And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away
 It just takes some time
 Little girl you're in the middle of the ride
 Everything, everything will be just fine
 Everything, everything will be alright, alright
 Hey, you know they're all the same
 You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in
 Live right now, yeah, just be yourself

__Title__ Take A Look Around By Limp Bizkit

All attention in the world today
 All the little girls fillin' up the world today
 When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
 But I'ma live my life like I should
 Now all the critics wanna hit it
 Shit can, now we did it
 Just because they don't get it
 But I'll stay fitted
 New era committed
 Now this red cap
 Gets a rap from his critics
 Do we always gotta cry
 Do we always gotta be inside a lie
 Life is just a blast movin' very fast
   
 Better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
 Follow me into a solo
 Remember that, kid
 So what you wanna do
 And where you gonna run
 When you starin' down a cable
 Of a mic pointed, that you grill like a gun
 Limp Bizkit is rocking the set
 It's like Russian roulette
 When you're placin' your bet
 So don't be upset
 When you're broke
 And you're done
 'Cause I'ma be the one
 Till I jet
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
   
 'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
 Why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 And now you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Does anybody really know the secret
 Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
 It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
 But everything happens for a reason
 I don't even know what I should say
 'Cause I'm an idiot a loser, microphone abuser
 I analyze every second I exist
 Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist
 And everybody wanna run
   
 Everybody wanna hide from the gun
 You can take that ride through this life if you want
 But you can't take that edge off that knife
 And now you want your money back
   
 But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sac
 And there ain't nothing I can do
 'Cause life is a lesson, you'll learn it when you're through
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Now you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Now I know why
 Now I know why
 Now I know why
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately

__Title__ Bring Me To Life By Evanescence

How can you see into my eyes like open doors
 Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
 Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
 Until you find it there and lead it back home
 Wake me up inside
 Wake me up inside
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run
 Before I come undone
 Save me from the nothing I've become
 Now that I know what I'm without
 You can't just leave me
 Breathe into me and
 Bring me to life
 Wake me up inside
 Wake me up inside
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run
 Before I come undone
 Save me from the nothing I've become
 Bring me to life
 I've been living a lie
 There's nothing inside
 Bring me to life
 Frozen inside without your touch
 Without your love, darling
 Only you all the life upon the die
 Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
 I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
 Got to open my eyes to everything
 Bring me to life
 Wake me up inside
 Wake me up inside
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run
 Before I come undone
 Save me from the nothing I've become
 Bring me to life
 There's nothing inside
 Bring me to life
 
__Title__ Savior By Rise Against

It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten
 What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
 As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is dropping
 Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten
 There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
 And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
 But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
 Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear
 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out
 'Cause I don't know
 That's when she said I don't hate you boy
 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
 That's when I told her I love you girl
 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh
 And the day pressed on like crushing weights
 For no man does it ever wait
 Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
 Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
 Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand
 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out
 'Cause I don't know
 That's when she said I don't hate you boy
 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
 That's when I told her I love you girl
 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh
 One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
 But so much left that I don't know
 We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
 It takes me under, it takes me under once again
 I don't hate you
 I don't hate you, no
 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out
 'Cause I don't know
 That's when she said I don't hate you boy
 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
 That's when I told her I love you girl
 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh
 I don't hate you
 I don't hate you, oh, oh
 I don't hate you
 I don't hate you, no, oh, oh
 
__Title__ Best Of You By Foo Fighters

I've got another confession to make
 I'm your fool
 Everyone's got their chains to break
 Holdin' you
 Were you born to resist, or be abused
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Or are you gone and onto someone new
 I needed somewhere to hang my head
 Without your noose
 You gave me something that I didn't have
 But had no use
 I was too weak to give in
 Too strong to lose
 My heart is under arrest again
 But I'll break loose
 My head is giving me life or death
 But I can't choose
 I swear I'll never give in
 I refuse
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Has someone taken your faith
 It's real, the pain you feel
 You trust, you must confess
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Has someone taken your faith
 It's real, the pain you feel
 The life, the love
 You'd die to heal
 The hope that starts
 The broken hearts
 You trust, you must confess
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 I've got another confession my friend
 I'm no fool
 I'm getting tired of starting again
 Somewhere new
 Were you born to resist, or be abused
 I swear I'll never give in, I refuse
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Has someone taken your faith
 It's real, the pain you feel
 You trust, you must confess
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 
__Title__ Numb By Linkin Park

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
 Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
 I don't know what you're expecting of me
 Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Become so tired, so much more aware
 I'm becoming this, all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 Can't you see that you're smothering me
 Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
 'Cause everything that you thought I would be
 Has fallen apart right in front of you
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 And every second I waste is more than I can take
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Become so tired, so much more aware
 I'm becoming this, all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 And I know I may end up failing too
 But I know, you were just like me
 With someone disappointed in you
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Become so tired, so much more aware
 I'm becoming this, all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Tryin' to be what you want me to be
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Tryin' to be what you want me to be
 
__Title__ The Diary Of Jane   Single Version By Breaking Benjamin

If I had to I would put myself right beside you
 So let me ask, would you like that
 And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
 So now I'll ask, do you like that
 No!
 Something's getting in the way
 Something's just about to break
 I will try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 So tell me how it should be!
 Try to find out what makes you tick
 As I lie down, sore and sick
 Do you like that
 There's a fine line between love and hate
 And I don't mind, just let me say
 That I like that, I like that
 Something's getting in the way
 Something's just about to break
 I will try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 As I burn another page
 As I look the other way
 I still try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 So tell me how it should be!
 Desperate, I will crawl, waiting for so long
 No love, there is no love
 Die for anyone, what have I become
 Something's getting in the way
 Something's just about to break
 I will try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 As I burn another page
 As I look the other way
 I still try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 
__Title__ Welcome To The Black Parade By My Chemical Romance

When I was a young boy
 My father took me into the city
 To see a marching band
 He said, 
 would you be the saviour of the broken
 the beaten and the damned
 He said 
 your demons, and all the non
 the plans that they have made
 A phantom to lead you in the summer
 To join The Black Parade
 When I was a young boy my father took me into the city
 to see a marching band
 you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten, and the damned
 Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
 And other times I feel like I should go
 When through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
 And when you're gone we want you all to know
 We'll carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're dead and gone believe me
 Your memory will carry on
 We'll carry on
 And in my heart I can't contain it
 The anthem won't explain it
 A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
 Your misery and hate will kill us all
 So paint it black and take it back
 Let's shout it loud and clear
 Defiant to the end we hear the call
 To carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're dead and gone believe me
 Your memory will carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're broken and defeated
 Your weary widow marches
 On and on we carry through the fears
 Ooh oh ohhhh
 Disappointed faces of your peers
 Ooh oh ohhhh
 Take a look at me cause I could not care at all
 Do or die, you'll never make me
 Because the world will never take my heart
 Go and try, you'll never break me
 We want it all, we wanna play this part
 I won't explain or say I'm sorry
 I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
 Give a cheer for all the broken
 Listen here, because it's who we are
 I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
 Just a boy, who had to sing this song
 I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
 I! don't! care!
 We'll carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're dead and gone believe me
 Your memory will carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're broken and defeated
 Your weary widow marches on
 Do or die, you'll never make me
 Because the world will never take my heart
 Go and try, you'll never break me
 We want it all, we wanna play this part 
 Do or die, you'll never make me 
 Because the world will never take my heart 
 Go and try, you'll never break me 
 We want it all, we wanna play this part

 Rattling bones

 Consumed,
 With the what's to transpire
 And you
 Your sex is on fire
 Consumed,

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
 I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way
 For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
 Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 You wear me out
 What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
 I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
 To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
 I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 You wear me out
 Forget about the dirty looks
 The photographs your boyfriend took
 You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed
 I'm okay
 I'm okay!
 I'm okay, now
 But you really need to listen to me
 Because I'm telling you the truth
 I mean this, I'm okay!
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 Well, I'm not okay
 I'm not o
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay

__Title__ When You Were Young By The Killers

You sit there in your heartache
 Waiting on some beautiful boy to
 To save you from your old ways
 You play forgiveness
 Watch him now, here he comes
 He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
 But he talks like a gentleman
 Like you imagined when you were young
 Can we climb this mountain
 Higher now than ever before
 I know we can make it if we take it slow
 That's takin' easy, easy now, watch it go
 Were burning down the highway skyline
 On the back of a hurricane that started turning
 When you were young
 When you were young
 And sometimes you close your eyes
 And see the place where you used to live
 When you were young
 They say the Devils water it aint so sweet
 You dont have to drink right now
 But you can dip your feet
 Every once in a little while
 You sit there in your heartache
 Waiting on some beautiful boy to
 To save you from your old ways
 You play forgiveness
 Watch him now, here he comes
 He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
 But he talks like a gentleman
 Like you imagined when you were young
 When you were young
 I said he doesnt look a thing like Jesus
 He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
 But more than youll ever know

Keep you in the dark
 You know they all pretend
 Keep you in the dark
 And so it all began
 Send in your skeletons
 Sing as their bones go marching in again
 They need you buried deep
 The secrets that you keep are ever ready
 Are you ready
 I'm finished making sense
 Done pleading ignorance
 That whole defense
 Spinning infinity
 Boy, the wheel is spinning me
 It's never ending, never ending
 Same old story
 What if I say I'm not like the others
 What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
 You're the pretender
 What if I say that I will never surrender
 What if I say I'm not like the others
 What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
 You're the pretender
 What if I say that I'll never surrender
 In time or so I'm told
 I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
 The page is out of print, we are not permanent
 We're temporary, temporary
 Same old story
 What if I say I'm not like the others
 What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
 You're the pretender
 What if I say that I'll never surrender
 What if I say I'm not like the others
 What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
 You're the pretender
 What if I say I will never surrender
 I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear
 I'm the face that you have to face, mirrorin' your stare
 I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
 I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees
 So who are you
 Yeah, who are you
 Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend
 What if I say I'm not like the others
 What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
 You're the pretender
 What if I say I will never surrender
 What if I say I'm not like the others

__Title__ It'S Been Awhile By Staind

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
 And it's been awhile since I first saw you
 And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
 And it's been awhile since I could call you
 And everything I can't remember
 As fucked up as it all may seem
 The consequences that I've rendered
 I've stretched myself beyond my means
 It's been awhile since I can say that I wasn't addicted
 And it's been awhile since I can say I love myself as well and
 And it's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up
 Just like I always do
 And it's been awhile but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you
 And everything I can't remember
 As fucked up as it all may seem
 The consequences that I've rendered
 I've gone and fucked things up again
 Why must I feel this way
 Just make this go away
 Just one more peaceful day
 And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
 And it's been awhile since I said, 
 And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
 And it's been awhile but I can still remember just the way you taste
 And everything I can't remember
 As fucked up as it all may seem to be
 I know it's me
 I cannot blame this on my father
 He did the best he could for me
 And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
 And it's been awhile since I said, 
 
__Title__ Face Down By The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus

Hey, girl, you know you drive me crazy
 one look puts the rhythm in my hand
 Still I'll never understand why you hang around
 I see what's going down
 Cover up with makeup in the mirror
 tell yourself, it's never gonna happen again
 You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
 Do you feel like a man when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 as your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
 A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
 every action in this world will bear a consequence
 If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
 I see what's going down
 I see the way you go and say you're right again,
 say you're right again
 Heed my lecture
 Do you feel like a man when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 as your lies crumble down, a new life she has
 One day she will tell you that she has had enough
 It's coming round again
 Do you feel like a man when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 as your lies crumble down, a new life she has
 Face down in the dirt, she said,

__Title__ She Hates Me By Puddle Of Mudd

Met a girl, thought she was grand
 Fell in love found out first hand
 Went well for a week or two
 Then it all came unglued
 In a trap, trip I can't grip
 Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
 Then I started to realize
 I was livin' one big lie
 She fuckin' hates me
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 La la la love
 I tried too hard and she tore my feelings
 Like I had none and ripped them away
 She was queen for about an hour
 After that, shit got sour
 She took all I ever had
 No sign of guilt, no feelin' bad no
 In a trap, trip I can't grip
 Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
 Then I started to realize
 I was livin' one big lie
 She fuckin' hates me
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 La la la love
 I tried too hard and she tore my feelings
 Like I had none and ripped them away
 That's my story, as you see
 Learned my lesson and so did she
 Now it's over and I'm glad
 'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said
 She fuckin' hates me
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 La la la love
 I tried too hard and she tore my feelings
 Like I had none and ripped them away
 Trust
 Trust
 And she tore my feelings like I had none
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 
__Title__ Uprising By Muse

Paranoia is in bloom
 The P
 They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
 And hope that we will never see the truth around 
 Another promise, another seed
 Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
 And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
 And endless red tape to keep the truth confined 
 They will not force us
 They will stop degrading us
 They will not control us
 We will be victorious 
 Interchanging mind control
 Come let the revolution take its toll
 If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
 You'd see that we should never be afraid to die 
 Rise up and take the power back
 It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
 You know that their time's coming to an end
 We have to unify and watch our flag ascend 
 They will not force us
 They will stop degrading us
 They will not control us
 We will be victorious 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 They will not force us
 They will stop degrading us
 They will not control us
 We will be victorious 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey

Your skin, your skin
 Look at the stars, look how they shine for you

 Oh, what a thing to do, my love
 And it was all yellow
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones

As he came into the window
 Was a sound of a crescendo
 He came into her apartment
 Left the bloodstains on the carpet
 She was sitting at the table

 She was struck down
 It was her doom

__Title__ The Anthem By Good Charlotte

Yeah, here we go
 It's a new day, but it all feels old
 It's a good life, that's what I'm told
 But everything, it all just feels the same
 And my high school, it felt more to me
 Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
 My time spent there, it only made me see
 That I don't ever wanna be like you
 I don't wanna do the things you do
 I'm never gonna hear the words you say
 And I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 You
 Don't wanna be you
 Go to college, a university
 Get a real job, that's what they said to me
 But I could never live the way they want
 I'm gonna get by and just do my time
 Out of step while they all get in line
 I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
 Do you really wanna be like them
 Do you really wanna be another trend
 Do you wanna be part of their crowd
 'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 You
 Don't wanna be you
 Shake it once, that's fine
 Shake it twice, that's okay
 Shake it three times
 You're playing with yourself again
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 This is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

I'm gonna make it bend and break
   
 Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
 In case God doesn't show
   
 And I want these words to make things right
 But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
 If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys
 One night and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Thanks for the memories
 See he tastes like you only sweeter
 I'm looking forward to the future
 But my eyesight is going bad
 And this crystal ball
 It's always cloudy except for, except for
 When you look into the past, look into the past
 One night stand
 One night stand
 One night and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Thanks for the memories
 See he tastes like you only sweeter
 They say I only think in the form of
 Crunching numbers in hotel rooms
 Collecting page six lovers
 Get me out of my mind
 Gets you out of those clothes
 I'm a liner away from
 Getting you into the mood
 One night and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time

__Title__ The Reason By Hoobastank

I'm not a perfect person
 There's many things I wish I didn't do
 But I continue learning
 I never meant to do those things to you
 And so I have to say before I go
 That I just want you to know
 I've found a reason for me
 To change who I used to be
 A reason to start over new
 And the reason is you
 I'm sorry that I hurt you
 It's something I must live with everyday
 And all the pain I put you through
 I wish that I could take it all away
 And be the one who catches all your tears
 That's why I need you to hear
 I've found a reason for me
 To change who I used to be
 A reason to start over new
 And the reason is you
 And the reason is you
 And the reason is you
 And the reason is you
 I'm not a perfect person
 I never meant to do those things to you
 And so I have to say before I go
 That I just want you to know
 I've found a reason for me
 To change who I used to be
 A reason to start over new
 And the reason is you
 I've found a reason to show
 A side of me you didn't know
 A reason for all that I do
 And the reason is you

 All night long I dream of the day,

 If I get any closer,
