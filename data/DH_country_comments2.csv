I was 37 then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through dense cloud cover on approach to Hamburg airport. Cold November rains drenched the earth, lending everything the gloomy air of a Flemish landscape: the ground crew in waterproofs, a flag atop a squat airport building, a BMW billboard. So - Germany again. Once the plane was on the ground, soft music began to flow from the ceiling speakers: a sweet orchestral cover version of the Beatles' ""Norwegian Wood"". The melody never failed to send a shudder through me, but this time it hit me harder than ever.

Hearing this song after finishing haruki murakami's Norweigan wood would never be the same as the time i listen to it the first time it was mentioned in the book. You'll close your eyes and see Watanabe, Naoko and reiko playing her guitar.

Just completed the book and brooding over this song over and over again while re reading the book. Murakami is a genius for he can make you feel whatever he wants you to feel even if you  have no intention of feeling so. A mark of a great author

Some books are like a portal, like you can almost step through it and be one with the characters. This book is one such. Whenever I think of Naoko, Toru, and Midori, I feel myself the fourth one lingering someplace close, very near, to their place...

My first day in Kaiserslaurten West Germany, I was young and on my own exploring the city,  a young American soldier. 
Its started snowing heavily and I ventured into a bar to get out of the cold. 
An older lady came to sit with me and asked if I was going to buy her a drink. After a couple of local beers and 2 very expensive glasses of champagne,  she gently place her palm on my thigh and squeezed as she explained to me that I could buy her time also,  in Deutsch or American currency.

Don't know why this popped-up in my YouTube feed, but I'm glad it did. And I'm grateful to you for posting your cover. Triggered a memory from 1974, when I finished writing my first novel. I worked until 1:23 am at Cessna Aircraft Company Factory Prospect Plant. Typically, I'd be home and start writing in my garage around 3 AM, write until 6 AM. Typewriter clackity-clacking was noisy, so I couldn't type in the house while the rest of the family was sleeping. On my way home one night I bought an album of Beatles songs and played it on an adjacent phonograph while I was at my typewriter. (Yes, we had 24-hour stores in 1974, even in Wichita, Kansas.) The album stuck on Norwegian Wood, so I'd hear Norwegian Wood over and over and over. Sometimes I'd reach over and move the needle, but not often. (And yes, commerce was commerce and they sold all manner of variations of Beatles songs in compilations. I recall that I bought this one because it had Paperback Writer, even though I ended up listening mostly to Norwegian Wood.) Eventually I became a paperback writer. Robert Beattie, New York Times bestselling author.

His best song, of many truly great ones. George was the soul of the Beatles, Paul the heart, John the mind, and Ringo the body-together, one God-given creative entity for the world, unsurpassed, forever.

You know, when George sings all those wonderful verses, you can apply them to George Harrison!

Did John Lennon and Paul McCartney ever realize and appreciate how much of an honor it was to know and work with George Harrison? George was such a special human being!

I have always thought George was underrated as a Beatle, and he certainly proved it when the Beatles broke up. George's grasp of reality and life is just amazing and the fact that he practiced and Eastern Religious teachings only enhanced his ability.

George's songs well up feelings in the listener that none of the other Beatles could. A sense of serenity,introspection and contemplation. Paul McCartney is my favorite Beatle but none of his songs instills the calming effect that George's do

Memories of cruising down the coastal highway in the back with my brother driving his 1969 mach1 mustang....I was around 8. I remember this playing. Since then to now in my mid 50s, every time I hear the song, I'm right back there. That's how impactful this song is.

I heard this song 30yrs ago when I was a child. I was sick, had chicken pox , and was listening to an oldies station when I went to bed. It's one of those inconsequential moments in your life that for some reason never forget. The ""Hop on the bus Gus, don't need to discuss much"" line has stuck in my head my entire life, having never heard the song again after that night. Finally, 30yrs later the line popped into my head again and I finally searched and found this song. I feel like I was teleported back to my childhood bedroom as a 7yr old kid as soon as this song started playing. The human mind is a funny thing sometimes.

My mom used to turn this song up when it would come on the radio and sing along like she had a memory instilled deeply within her that was important, or dear to her. The last time I broke it off with a girl before meeting my wife of 12 years now I walked to my car, turned the key, and this song played upon the radio. A song and memory unlocked to me as of recent that I had forgotten.

This song was really ahead of its time,   in that it acknowledged that men could be stuck in toxic relationships as well as women and also had the right to tell someone and leave.  Also, it's fun and catchy as hell.

My parents divorced when I was 9. I spent every other weekend with my dad but being a daddy's girl, it was never enough for me. He was a big Paul Simon fan and we sang along to his music in dad's car every Sunday when he took me to my mom's. This was always my favorite of all the songs and now that my dad is gone, it always reminds me of him. Thank you for uploading it!

This song means so much to me. I am about to 29 this Halloween... But when I was in highschool, it was like my ""bestfriend"" song with my homie. We just loved it so much like all classic music. But we were particularly fond of this one... Unfortunately my bestfriend passed away coming to my house my senior year in a car accident. But you know what was weird? Is that this song came on the radio when I was driving to the funeral. Of course I busted into tears. At the same time though. It kinda felt like he was reassuring me that he was okay and in a better place. Still to this day.. This song makes me think about everything. Why he was taken so young. All I can come up with is the old saying - the good always die young. Or something to that affect. Because Dusty was a spectacular person. Never in my 29 years met anymore more genuine, caring, talented, and badass as him. Anyway. Hope this doesn't make anyone sad, its not the point. I just had to honestly vent. Even if it is to the ""open air"" like this text box.

My dad used to sing this fairly often, especially the line ""hop on the bus, Gus"" when he and I would take the bus together. I completely forgot about this entirely for many years until this morning when my boss gave my a ride to work really early in the morning just as the sun was coming up. He turned on the radio and this came on and I was like wow, how did I forget about this song.

50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Paul Simon,"I heard this song 30yrs ago when I was a child. I was sick, had chicken pox , and was listening to an oldies station when I went to bed. It's one of those inconsequential moments in your life that for some reason never forget. The ""Hop on the bus Gus, don't need to discuss much"" line has stuck in my head my entire life, having never heard the song again after that night. Finally, 30yrs later the line popped into my head again and I finally searched and found this song. I feel like I was teleported back to my childhood bedroom as a 7yr old kid as soon as this song started playing.

50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Paul Simon,"This song means so much to me. I am about to 29 this Halloween... But when I was in highschool, it was like my ""bestfriend"" song with my homie. We just loved it so much like all classic music. But we were particularly fond of this one... Unfortunately my bestfriend passed away coming to my house my senior year in a car accident. But you know what was weird? Is that this song came on the radio when I was driving to the funeral. Of course I busted into tears. At the same time though. It kinda felt like he was reassuring me that he was okay and in a better place. Still to this day.. This song makes me think about everything. Why he was taken so young. All I can come up with is the old saying - the good always die young. Or something to that affect. Because Dusty was a spectacular person. Never in my 29 years met anymore more genuine, caring, talented, and badass as him. Anyway. Hope this doesn't make anyone sad, its not the point. I just had to honestly vent. Even if it is to the ""open air"" like this text box.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABXtWqmArUU

I remember as a young 19 year old in 1967 on my way to Vietnam in a U.S. Navy ship. Singing this new song and already wishing I was homeward bound. Finally in 1968 when my tour of duty ended came back to America, San Francisco, I kissed the ground when I got off the ship. I was home. Here I am age 75 and how this song brings back memories. Where did the last 55 years go to. One moment I'm a kid and the next moment I'm an elderly man.

Simon and Garfunkel‚Äôs music helped shape a generation. After a more than successful duo career, they both became exceptional solo artists. The concert in Central Park still blows my mind. Throughout all their differences, they were able to come together for my favorite concert ever.

January 31 1968 2;45 P.M., I'm on a Medivac flight  with My left leg blown all to hell and as that Freedom Bird leaves the tarmac headed for America and the landing gear clunks into place the Pilot plays this song and the entire flight breaks into silence as it sinks in.

Why is there no one this good anymore? These two and a few others were the soundtrack of my life for so long. And in some ways still are: This album is part of the #1 playlist on my phone. What fascinates me now is that my kids, 27 and 32, still know this music and appreciate it more than the stuff today's bands and songwriters create and produce.  The best music lasts a very long time.

This man was underrated in my opinion because even though he mostly performed covers, he almost always made versions that were as good or better, and ALWAYS different from the the original. Look at his ease of singing and the effectiveness of his approach in creating a totally energetic and exciting performance. That's a mark of genius. There's a selflessness in his commitment to the song. He's not there to promote Richie Havens but to promote the awesomeness of music. Thank you RH!!

I shook his hand once and it was huge! Seemed like it wrapped around mine twice and I have pretty good sized hands myself. I feel in love with his voice watching the movie ""Woodstock"". I love how Richie made a song his own. I don't like slavish covers and this song is one of my go to examples of what I do like.

Here Comes The Sun,Richie Havens,"This man was underrated in my opinion because even though he mostly performed covers, he almost always made versions that were as good or better, and ALWAYS different from the the original. Look at his ease of singing and the effectiveness of his approach in creating a totally energetic and exciting performance. That's a mark of genius. There's a selflessness in his commitment to the song. He's not there to promote Richie Havens but to promote the awesomeness of music. Thank you RH!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOotCVMFncE

I remember buying this album a number of years ago in my early teens when I was just getting into vinyl and Dylan. Didn't know any of the songs. I remember it was a cold winter afternoon but the sun was shining when I put this on my turntable for the first time. Bob's voice was so mellow and the lyrics were so bittersweet and I was captivated. Listening to this song just brings back all the memories and feelings I had when I was around that age. Will always love this song the most x

I feel like this song and era are John at his most Dylan influenced. He said Dylan got him to focus more on the lyrics than just the music/sounds and I feel like Help/Rubber Soul is when John started turning more inwards when it came to his songwriting and writing more from the heart as opposed to just factory made love songs. His vocals are pretty Dylan heavy here too.

There is something wrong with the audio. I am thankful this video is back up though. It was up on YouTube, years ago...and then disappeared. For years it was gone. Now it is back...but it would be just our luck...the audio is jacked up on it. Oh well. I suppose...when it is The Beatles...we should just feel fortunate we have what we have. What a beautiful piece of work by John. One of his best melodies, and such superb lyrics. A precursor to the great, Rubber Soul album.  Often felt as though...this would have fit perfectly on Rubber Soul.

I suppose...when it is The Beatles...we should just feel fortunate we have what we have. What a beautiful piece of work by John. One of his best melodies, and such superb lyrics. A precursor to the great, Rubber Soul album.  Often felt as though...this would have fit perfectly on Rubber Soul.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVXgpLeAfAY

I took parts of The Monkees music romp from the 1967 episode ""Monkees In Paris"" and added the second version of Me And Magdalena from The Monkees new album 'Good Times"". I hope you will enjoy this little video.  This is for entertainment purposes for Monkees fans to enjoy.  I do not own the copyright to either the song or video used.

I'm completely in love with this song. Both versions. It's more than the song, which is glorious. But Mike and Micky sound so lovely and it's so heartwarming to know that they ""still got it."" Ya know? I'm so happy.

The main thing I like the most about Good Times! is they brought the old sound. This sounds better fast. I would have loved to see them one more time. I saw them in 1999 and it was a great show.

This video is fantastic. I love this song but to pair it with views of NYC from circa 1970 is a genius move. It captures the feeling beautifully. Of course the people alive in NYC back then would hardly recognize Manhattan today. It's like an urban Disneyland, made safe for tourists. I woke up with this song in my head and found this video. To whoever did it, thank you.

This was one of those records that even though I was only 10 really made me stop and listen. I really loved the harmony and I'd play it over and over in my head long after it had finished. Whenever the radio was on I'd try and will the DJ to play it. I still love listening to it, by far my favourite S&G track. Good times. Special times and we knew it even then. We haven't waited fifty years to realise it. We lived it

Paul wrote this song in response to being cut from the movie ""Catch 22"" by Mike Nichols. He had cast Paul and Artie for the movie, but cut Paul's part. Paul still had to write the music and was bitter. Thus began the Simon & Garfunkel feud.

There's a lot of debate about Art being along for the ride with Paul's gravy train but to me they were the only artists from the north american side that were as good as the Beatles. Paul solo wouldn't have done it.

The Only Living Boy in New York,Simon & Garfunkel,God I wish the simplicity and quality of this kind of music could come back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhoRXht_UgI
The Only Living Boy in New York,Simon & Garfunkel,"This video is fantastic. I love this song but to pair it with views of NYC from circa 1970 is a genius move. It captures the feeling beautifully. Of course the people alive in NYC back then would hardly recognize Manhattan today. It's like an urban Disneyland, made safe for tourists. I woke up with this song in my head and found this video. To whoever did it, thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhoRXht_UgI
The Only Living Boy in New York,Simon & Garfunkel,The brilliance of this video is the simplicity...the innocence of simple image and a magnificent sound.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhoRXht_UgI

The Only Living Boy in New York,Simon & Garfunkel,"This was one of those records that even though I was only 10 really made me stop and listen. I really loved the harmony and I'd play it over and over in my head long after it had finished. Whenever the radio was on I'd try and will the DJ to play it.

From their movie ""The Last Waltz"" with The Staple Singers - 

I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head.
""Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook my hand, and ""No!"", was all he said.

(Chorus:)
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free;
Take a load off Fannie, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, ""Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown.""
She said, ""I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around.""

(Chorus)

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day.
""Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?""

(Chorus)

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.
He said, ""I will fix your rags, if you'll take Jack, my dog.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man.""
He said, ""That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.""

(Chorus)

Catch a Cannonball, now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time.
To get back to Miss Annie, you know she's the only one.
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.

(Chorus)

For me this immensely soulful groove takes on a whole other dimension at 1:01 when Mavis Staples' glorious voice chimes in, and the camera pans over and shows Levon grooving and smiling, knowing that they are creating magic. It doesn't get any better than this.

The Weight,The Band,"From their movie ""The Last Waltz"" with The Staple Singers - 

I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head.
""Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook my hand, and ""No!"", was all he said.

(Chorus:)
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free;
Take a load off Fannie, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, ""Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown.""
She said, ""I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around.""

(Chorus)

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day.
""Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?""

(Chorus)

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.
He said, ""I will fix your rags, if you'll take Jack, my dog.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man.""
He said, ""That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.""

(Chorus)

Catch a Cannonball, now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time.
To get back to Miss Annie, you know she's the only one.
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.

(Chorus)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-w9OclUnns

Cat's delivery of this song takes me right back to when it first came out. I was 18 at the time and new to the ways of love. After getting dumped out of a particularly steamy relationship I was acutely aware of how much it hurt. And that made Cat's caring farewell to the one who dumped him all the more poignant.

I grew up listening to Cat. Terrific singer that made classic songs. A few years ago while standing in customer service at a Wal-Mart, I had his music playing on my phone. The cashier said in a very disapproving tone, ""You know, he's Muslim!"" I just said smiling, ""I don't care, I love his music.""

He gave me his entire record collection after he passed away. I have a lot of great memories of us sitting around and listening to albums. I know he's always, always with me. Especially because I carry his ashes around with me in this Jamba Juice cup.

The period between 60s-80s (and some part of 90s too) carried heart of music. Music had its soul then. Often missed now.

He has a great voice, and for a time was one of the greatest songwriters.
I admire him for just walking away from it, and staying sane (in a fashion), but we probably missed out on some great rock music.

Beautiful man and touching song. 
I love this video so much, especially how his deeply emotional yet understated voice fills the room with the first line.
Maybe it‚Äôs also his authenticity that helps me find him relatable even in 2020.

Cat Stevens was SO BIG in the 70's....In a relatively short career, he had so many classic songs, starting with this one...For Boomers like myself, his tunes were part of the soundtrack of our youth

I had never heard of Cat Stevens until the mid to late 70's. Then my sister started dating someone who she eventually married. I remember going to sleep with this man's voice every night. I had never heard a voice that soothing. I found out who he was and have been a firm fan every since.

Back in the early 1970s in Tehran, anyone who had a turntable or a cassette player, also had an album or two from Cat Stevens. When I arrived in the UK in 1974, when I used to get homesick, I'd visit my Iranian friends. They all used to play this song for me, just to remind me of home. LOL. This song still rocks.

For those who may have missed my previous comments. I compiled and uploaded this so I could explain my love of Van-Gogh's art to a dear friend of mine and thought McLean's Stary Stary Night was perfect in helping to explain. The lyrics were strictly for the benefit of my Friend, who's first language is not English.I never imagined it would get so many views and comments. I'm so glad I was able to share.

I dedicated this song to my Mom. She committed suicide when I was 15, going on 16. She was only 36 years old. She loved to draw, and she was very good at it, but she never thought she was. She lost her Mom to a heart attack, when she was only 11 years old. She had a VERY hard life, and she never thought she was worth anything to anyone. I'm going on 60 now, and I still miss her. I didn't get to grow up with her because my father kidnapped me and my brothers, and the State found out, and they kidnapped us, and put us in different foster homes. This song brings it all back..., it still brings tears to my eyes. You never stop loving the people you truly care about, and nothing ever fills the empty space they leave in your heart. I write poetry, and I wrote a poem many years ago, called Phyllis.

This song holds such a powerful message for those suffering from mental illness. Because these are usually the kindest, sweetest and truest among us. They are gifted, many artfully or musically and their works are an expression of the love they hold inside. Like Vincent they too struggle to live in this tough world. Please remember to be kind.

Don McLean, in my opinion, is perhaps America's greatest poet ever. When should listen to him explain the lyrics to American pie. This is a man who not only can sing exquisitely, but a man who can create unmatched beauty in his words. I don't know of any other poet who can move my heart to this degree. What an American treasure. What a treasure to the world.

‚ÄúI think the purest of souls, those with the most fragile of hearts, must be meant for a short life. They can't be tethered or held in your palm.



Just like a sparrow, they light on your porch. Their song might be brief, but how greedy would we be to ask for more? No, you cannot keep a sparrow. You can only hope that as they fly away, they take a little bit of you with them.‚Äù

Today is Vincent's birthday. I first heard this song in my teens and loved the song but wondered who Vincent was. Once I learned the meaning of the song as it relates to Van Gogh's life, I vowed to someday see his paintings in person. Visiting the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam a few years ago, I had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat and as I walked through, I felt such a beautiful sadness. My girlfriend who loved to draw and sketch recently committed suicide and now I have an ever deeper understanding of what he was trying to say to me and yes, even more sadness.

The sad thing is there're lots of Vincent out there. Make good art, still unrecognized and those who make cheap art at tik tok or social media are more appreciated. People would not listen and yes, they still don't know how. All they care for art is how it looks real or how it matches with real things. They don't think, they don't look. Perhaps they never will.

This is absolutely the best version of the song I've ever heard and the images of the paintings are what make it so good. It gave me a much deeper insight into Vincent Van Gogh than I had before. It took me years before I came to appreciate his works, I liked them but I didn't fully appreciate them and what he put into them of himself. I hope I'm making sense here, the only art class I ever had was when I needed an elective in my Sr year. I got my education in appreciating art from watching Sister Wendy and Bob Ross.

I  was deeply touched by Van Gogh‚Äôs story, his suffering and sad that he felt so misunderstood and unappreciated :  that he was never able to experience the love and joy he has given to the world and continues to do so 130 years later.  What am impression to make on the entire world,, and he died never knowing‚Ä¶.This song was popular when I was a teen and I loved it then, but wow, does it affect me now!!!  Don McLean understood deeply and wrote this beautiful tribute song that clearly shows his own love and appreciation for Van Gogh.  Thank you for putting this together.  The music and lyrics are hauntingly beautiful set to the hauntingly beautiful works of a master.

Vincent,Don McLean,"Don McLean's Vincent (Starry,Starry Night) Almost all images created by Vincent Van- Gogh. Song by Don McLean I in no way assume any credit for song or images.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk
Vincent,Don McLean,"For those who may have missed my previous comments. I compiled and uploaded this so I could explain my love of Van-Gogh's art to a dear friend of mine and thought McLean's Stary Stary Night was perfect in helping to explain. The lyrics were strictly for the benefit of my Friend, who's first language is not English.I never imagined it would get so many views and comments. I'm so glad I was able to share.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk
Vincent,Don McLean,"I dedicated this song to my Mom. She committed suicide when I was 15, going on 16. She was only 36 years old. She loved to draw, and she was very good at it, but she never thought she was. She lost her Mom to a heart attack, when she was only 11 years old. She had a VERY hard life, and she never thought she was worth anything to anyone. I'm going on 60 now, and I still miss her. I didn't get to grow up with her because my father kidnapped me and my brothers, and the State found out, and they kidnapped us, and put us in different foster homes. This song brings it all back..., it still brings tears to my eyes. You never stop loving the people you truly care about, and nothing ever fills the empty space they leave in your heart. I write poetry, and I wrote a poem many years ago, called Phyllis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk
Vincent,Don McLean,"This song holds such a powerful message for those suffering from mental illness. Because these are usually the kindest, sweetest and truest among us.

Please remember to be kind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk

Vincent,Don McLean,"Don McLean, in my opinion, is perhaps America's greatest poet ever. When should listen to him explain the lyrics to American pie. This is a man who not only can sing exquisitely, but a man who can create unmatched beauty in his words. I don't know of any other poet who can move my heart to this degree. What an American treasure. What a treasure to the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk
Vincent,Don McLean,"‚ÄúI think the purest of souls, those with the most fragile of hearts, must be meant for a short life. They can't be tethered or held in your palm.



Just like a sparrow, they light on your porch. Their song might be brief, but how greedy would we be to ask for more? No, you cannot keep a sparrow. You can only hope that as they fly away, they take a little bit of you with them.‚Äù",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk

He passed away a couple of months ago so I listened to it now as often as I can in the hope that he can hear it too",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk
Vincent,Don McLean,"Today is Vincent's birthday. I first heard this song in my teens and loved the song but wondered who Vincent was. Once I learned the meaning of the song as it relates to Van Gogh's life, I vowed to someday see his paintings in person. Visiting the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam a few years ago, I had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat and as I walked through, I felt such a beautiful sadness. My girlfriend who loved to draw and sketch recently committed suicide and now I have an ever deeper understanding of what he was trying to say to me and yes, even more sadness.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk

It took me years before I came to appreciate his works, I liked them but I didn't fully appreciate them and what he put into them of himself. I hope I'm making sense here, the only art class I ever had was when I needed an elective in my Sr year. I got my education in appreciating art from watching Sister Wendy and Bob Ross.

My dad passed from a heart attack very unexpectedly last month. I picked this song to play at his funeral. He loved the Beatles and this song is just so fitting of his life well lived. My dad was one in a million. Loved by everyone. He was the hardest worker I know and loved his wife, four daughters and their husbands and his 6 grandchildren like no other. He never missed a game for any of his daughters or grandchildren. I miss him so much it pains me. Still can‚Äôt believe it.

I heard from folks I know who were living in the 60s that when ""In My Life"" first hit, that's the exact moment when The Beatles became bigger than life. This song was the moment where The Beatles separated themselves from every other artist, and entered a different stratosphere of popularity and profoundness....and that gap exploded when Revolver dropped the following year, expanded much, much more when Pepper dropped the year after.

My late husband really admired Bob Dylan, and my husband was quite a man so that says a lot to me in and of itself. He LOVED Bob Dylan. I do too, but now I feel warm but sad when I hear his songs. I want my husband with me and singing along or playing his guitar along with it. Not having him here playing Dylan's songs..........I don't have words how it feels. Others like me will understand. My situation is not unique. He played a lot of Dylan's songs on his Martin. Those are among my favorite times with him. We enjoyed playing and singing Dylan songs and some others minimum 3 times a week. We'd sit across from each other on the sofa, play guitar and singing together! I mean, how awesome is that to do with your hubby!!!  So: THANK YOU Bob, for sharing your genius. I don't think there will be another like Dylan, ever. I am also very grateful Bob wrote some of the most amazing music of all time and because of that, along with the music,  I have these memories of my husband, that are very dear.  It's pretty cool. Peace!

""Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there...with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair...she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns..come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm.""  This is directly from my own life experience after Vietnam. A lovely, generous, understanding young lady saved my life. We lost each other, but I still love her 47 years later. Obviously, I love this song.

This song always reminds me of my late father. When I was a kid, he was the one who showed me this song. I was riding with him in his truck. Dylan's the greatest singer/songwriter of all time. No one else compares to what he's done and continues to do.

When Bob's album Blood on the Tracks came out I played it over and over. It was THE best album he ever did. It still plays as good as when it first came out. Every song a wonderful single to be savoured. Bob is now 80 years old and he will surely, "" make me lonesome when he goes."" I hope he stays around a few more years.

I love this song. It reminds me of a time when I was kinda just drifting around and met a great man. Regardless of his sexuality, age, education level or lifestyle he was a dear friend of mine.... He respected my boundaries and never made me feel like I was a bad man and inspired me to let go of all the pain and love and live again. He was gay and I am not, but regardless I loved him as a friend and cherished our time together and all the conversations we had. I never knew he was a dying man and I didn't want to believe it whe he said he'd be dead by the time I graduated from college. 3 years later I came home after graduation and was applying to pharmacy school and find out he'd past away. I'm in my P1 year and honestly if I'd never met him.... I don't think i would have ever got my head back from out the clouds and clean up my life and get focused. I miss you Roger LaPrade, this is for you. God bless you may you rest in peace! I can still you smiling singing this with me still my friend. Until we meet again... RIP

40 years this song has been taking my breath away. It's so much more than imcomparable poetry. The lyrics, music, vocals, and arrangement together make it a unique work of art. It's mind blowing how much The Beatles and Dylan changed music and culture in just a few years.

Listened to this on my first trip to Mexico in 75.  Still remember driving through the Sonoran desert with the full moon shining.  The desert glowed as I began my 27 year sojourn as an international gypsy.   Eventually came to realize the answers were all waiting for me inside.  Still enjoy experiencing different culture, language, landscapes, foods, world views, and so much more.  ""I'm sailing away my own true love.  I'm sailing away in the morning....""

I can‚Äôt hear this song without weeping. It hurts so much. Sometimes I feel so lost in it. Like a life once lived but then crushed by malice and hate. The malice and hate was me. It was the song that was life. It always was. And I feel like I missed it somehow. And that‚Äôs what makes me sad.

It is a treasure to see him perform this song when the  pain was still fresh and when it hadn't been performed 1000's of times. This song has always hit hard for me but even harder watching the  pain he  is  in performing it. He could  have kept this song to himself but he chose to share  it with  us and I for  one am eternally thankful he did.

Absolutely spellbinding. Nobody sings and plays acoustic guitar like James - so effortlessly makes the guitar sound like an orchestra - and his voice reached into your soul. I have been performing acoustic folk-rock since around 1970 and James has been one of my very biggest inspirations - still is.

It's always chilling watching artists perform famous legendary songs before they became massive hits. This song is now one of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and here he is quietly introducing and playing it to minimal response at the beginning. Nowadays if James starts picking that intro it will send audiences into rapturous applause

Lyric:

I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get you all
It's a pink moon
It's a pink, pink, pink, pink, pink moon.

Every time there is a Pink Moon, like tonight , millions of people must think of Nick Drake and the melancholy power of his great song, which is about him and about everyone, in those words.  His work is like a tree, static and rooted, in his short life, yet always able to move its myriad branches and its whole trunk, in the slightest breeze, for all of us to enjoy.

I remember the night I first heard this song, a musician myself in my twenties, cutting my teeth in the Austin, Texas music scene. The clubs had all closed down, and the night owls went to a 24 hour cafe called Magnolia Cafe near a lake. I got a seat by the window; ordered pancakes and was staring up at a full moon with pink clouds blowing across it, the kind you see in Austin because of the reflection of the city lights on the atmosphere. Pink Moon came on the sound system. I will never forget.

12:49am July 29, 2021 I'm writing this comment. I had an emotional conversation with my dad about my own personal hell I've gone through these past couple weeks, decided randomly after all was said and done to listen to this album for the first time. I know nothing about Nick Drake other than he has a couple albums. After listening through it and coming back to the first track, I felt what I can only describe as love.

Nick Drake was an original guitarist/songwriter who burned out way too early in his life. His confused and troubled mind reflected a depression that he could no longer live with. He left us some beautiful, dark ballads along his brief life's path that to this day are often copied but totally unmatched in their originality.

I recently played this for a friend that had never heard of Nick. She had no idea what his story was. I asked her to listen, give me feedback, then I would tell her about him. How astute she was in her response! ""Why"", she asked, ""do I feel a hidden threat in this song/poem?"" THAT is the power of a good poet! Of course there is threat here: below the radar, beneath the words. He's only days from taking his own life. That must be resonating beneath his consciousness. And it communicated, in this beautiful poem/song, to a woman who would hear him for the first time, come to know who he was,  more than 40 years after he left. That is amazing to me. That is the mark of a real poet.

June 19, 1948. Nick would've been 63 today. I read that he told his mother, ""If my music ever did anything for one person, it would be worth it."" Seeing that this video has nearly 500k views, I bet he is smiling.
Happy Birthday, Nick.

This song brings memories of a simpler time for me
I remember a specific memory in fact. I was a young child and I was in the car with my dad driving us home from a long day at the water park. I was so excited to be sitting on the front passenger seat. It was twilight and the day was ending and my dad put this song on. I remember we both created imaginary sceanarios like floating to the moon or what it would be like to have liquid chocolate rain. It stayed with me. At the time I felt like everything was alright and everything was going to be ok.

By the time Drake recorded this in the fall of '71 he had retreated so deeply into his own world of self isolation and depression. He quietly and discreetly recorded this with just the sound engineer over a two night period. The record label was not even aware he had recorded it. One day he walked into the Island Records office to deliver the master tapes but just sat on a bench quietly until an office personnel noticed him and invited him upstairs for a cup of tea. Drake never mentioned the new recordings and the office guy wasn't aware of any new music so Drake just sat there for a half hour not speaking and then left. On his way out the door he put the master tapes on the front desk and walked away for good. It was a while before anyone even noticed the tapes were there. Drake's involvement with post production was extremely minimal due to his deteriorating condition. He never promoted it or played it for an audience.

This album is now 50 years old, and it's my favorite album. There's something about Nick's voice, the complex guitar, the general noise of the old recording technology, and the understated lyrics that make this album so personal to me. It feels like Nick is a friend or some sort of prophet offering equivocal poetry as counsel, while playing his pacifying guitar. This album is the ambience of my bedroom which houses me and exclusively me‚Äîwell, me and the apparition of Nick.

I first heard this song 2 weeks ago. What is weird is that i heard it randomly on a playlist on spotify and at the time i thought it was a brand new song, it sounded so recent and modern to my ears, a complete challenge to the status quo of classical guitar music. When i found out it was written nearly 50 years ago by a guy who committed suicide shortly after writing it i had shivers. Im now obsessed by it and Nick drake continues to blow my mind. A musician born before his time.

Pink Moon,Nick Drake,"I remember the night I first heard this song, a musician myself in my twenties, cutting my teeth in the Austin, Texas music scene. The clubs had all closed down, and the night owls went to a 24 hour cafe called Magnolia Cafe near a lake. I got a seat by the window; ordered pancakes and was staring up at a full moon with pink clouds blowing across it, the kind you see in Austin because of the reflection of the city lights on the atmosphere. Pink Moon came on the sound system. I will never forget.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXnfhnCoOyo

Pink Moon,Nick Drake,"Nick Drake was an original guitarist/songwriter who burned out way too early in his life. His confused and troubled mind reflected a depression that he could no longer live with. He left us some beautiful, dark ballads along his brief life's path that to this day are often copied but totally unmatched in their originality. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXnfhnCoOyo

Pink Moon,Nick Drake,"I recently played this for a friend that had never heard of Nick. She had no idea what his story was. I asked her to listen, give me feedback, then I would tell her about him. How astute she was in her response! ""Why"", she asked, ""do I feel a hidden threat in this song/poem?"" THAT is the power of a good poet! Of course there is threat here: below the radar, beneath the words. He's only days from taking his own life. That must be resonating beneath his consciousness. And it communicated, in this beautiful poem/song, to a woman who would hear him for the first time, come to know who he was,  more than 40 years after he left. That is amazing to me. That is the mark of a real poet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXnfhnCoOyo

I remember a specific memory in fact. I was a young child and I was in the car with my dad driving us home from a long day at the water park. I was so excited to be sitting on the front passenger seat. It was twilight and the day was ending and my dad put this song on. I remember we both created imaginary sceanarios like floating to the moon or what it would be like to have liquid chocolate rain. It stayed with me. At the time I felt like everything was alright and everything was going to be ok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXnfhnCoOyo

Pink Moon,Nick Drake,By the time Drake recorded this in the fall of '71 he had retreated so deeply into his own world of self isolation and depression. He quietly and discreetly recorded this with just the sound engineer over a two night period. The record label was not even aware he had recorded it. One day he walked into the Island Records office to deliver the master tapes but just sat on a bench quietly until an office personnel noticed him and invited him upstairs for a cup of tea. Drake never mentioned the new recordings and the office guy wasn't aware of any new music so Drake just sat there for a half hour not speaking and then left. On his way out the door he put the master tapes on the front desk and walked away for good. It was a while before anyone even noticed the tapes were there. Drake's involvement with post production was extremely minimal due to his deteriorating condition. He never promoted it or played it for an audience.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXnfhnCoOyo

There's something about Nick's voice, the complex guitar, the general noise of the old recording technology, and the understated lyrics that make this album so personal to me. It feels like Nick is a friend or some sort of prophet offering equivocal poetry as counsel, while playing his pacifying guitar.

So sad they parted ways. They where both at their very best as a duo. The blending of their amazing voices and songs was a major part of the history of music at that time..  Great as solo acts - but were beyond amazing together... Glad I had a chance as a baby boomer to share in real time the amazing duo of Simon and Garfunkel..

This concert was performed when cable tv was a brand new thing in my area. I remember HBO played this concert over and over and I would watch it every chance I got as an 11 year old boy. As of 6 minutes ago, I just hit my 50th birthday and I am enjoying this concert yet again while the rest of my house sleeps. So beautiful! What a blessing! Long Live Simon and Garfunkel!

This was one of my top 2 concerts. Magical night, it had rained most of the day & that kept the crowd #‚Äôs down. Thru some very fortunate events, we wound up about 50 rows from the front of the stage. My buddies, against my advice brought beer & were gone by mid concert in search of a bathroom. I vividly remember Paul sneering singing the ‚ÄòFeeling Groovy/59th St bridge song‚Äô, now the Ed Koch bridge. Magical concert & night.

Im 16 and Im a Billy Joel listener for years now. He is just so perfect and touches my feelings, emotions at the second I hear a song of his, especially Vienna and this one and he is so timeless. It makes you think about people, yourself, life, love and that is something that defines a big artist to me. I wish there was a second Billy Joel at my time.

This has to be one of the best written songs. I grew up not being allowed to listen to anything much outside of religious songs. I remember when I heard my first JOEL song, this was it, needless to say at 19 years of age I was on a quest to listen to ""them all"" before I died...lol I am still alive and loving every single note! from 1979 -present God Bless you JOEL , always.

Lots of comments on the relationship this song is depicting. But it's about his ex-wife Elizabeth Weber who literally saved him from some financial ruin. It isn't about a toxic relationship - whether they had one or not - it's about Joel's reaction to the things said about his wife by those trying to take the mic (and his money).

An instrumental version of this played on a playlist used to entertain visitors of the original WTC complex and played during 9/11 as the attacks unfolded, people jumping and the eventual collapse. This song played till the towers fell like a farewell siren to all those they faithfully served till the bitter end. This is why this song has such a profound meaning to me.

This was one of my son's favourite songs even though it came out when i was young. His father and i took him to see Fleetwood Mac in Perth Australia and he loved it. He suffered from severe depression and we lost him in August 21. We played this at his funeral and it reminds me of his dad half carrying him out of the  concert as he'd suffered nerve damage in one of his attempts to end his life. We fought valiantly to keep him in this world but it caught us by surprise when he was in a great place. He died in his sleep. I think he was too pure and good for this world. My heart is broken. This song was played at his funeral and it was the hardest time. I miss him every day.

Landslide,Fleetwood Mac,This was one of my son's favourite songs even though it came out when i was young. His father and i took him to see Fleetwood Mac in Perth Australia and he loved it. He suffered from severe depression and we lost him in August 21. We played this at his funeral and it reminds me of his dad half carrying him out of the  concert as he'd suffered nerve damage in one of his attempts to end his life. We fought valiantly to keep him in this world but it caught us by surprise when he was in a great place. He died in his sleep. I think he was too pure and good for this world. My heart is broken.

I spent my youth listening to Cat Stevens.  Played and sang his songs.  Know them all.  What brought me here is someone doing an analysis video of classic tunes.  Hadn't heard Cat in decades.  What a joy it was to listen again.  They harken to another time....but they're still great songs.  So prolific he was.

Famously, footsteps were made by Paul as he played guitar. George Martin didn't like this idea and was more in favour of beeps at random intervals. The pair were at loggerheads over which direction to go in. Eventually McCartney won out, but did agree to record a version with the beeps which influenced a young Brian Eno who was pottering about in the studio. It was released on limited edition vinyl and finally unearthed by 'Just a Beatles fan'.

The pair were at loggerheads over which direction to go in. Eventually McCartney won out, but did agree to record a version with the beeps which influenced a young Brian Eno who was pottering about in the studio. It was released on limited edition vinyl and finally unearthed by 'Just a Beatles fan'.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpn_lGaTOEo

I'm an old man over 60 years old, and it's my daily routine to watch the video of Paul's main performance in Japan and sing along with him every day with a guitar in my hand, but even after listening to it many times, I'm still amazed at Paul's deep and artistic singing skills. Of course, it goes without saying that Peter and Marie's skills are also amazing.

Magical... They were just wonderful in concert. I remember them signing autographs and talking to fans for 2 hours after a 3 hour concert. They just loved the younger fans, stocking up the next generation. Mary always marveled at the grandkids of their early fans. They were in love with music, and all they could do with it. Peter and Paul wrote a few standards. The Wedding Song by Peter, and Day Is Done by Paul. Standards. Their guitars and their harmony were as strong as any folk singers.

This is an astounding version of an incredible song (with Dylan just 22 when writing it).  I love the guitar solo that Peter does at the opening and have based my playing of it mostly on that wonderful instrumental.  Perfect singing too.

Iconic. Where have the years gone. Lord, this song is perfection. Two perfect guitars, three part harmony, great song! The 3 of you had a way of complimenting each other. It is a gift. Saw you many times over the years. Wedding Song, and Day is Done are a couple of your best contributions. Mary will always be missed. She was special, as we all are....

They were the heart and soul of the folk era.  I have had great good fortune to see them in live performances three times over the years.  The first was in 1965 in Knoxville, TN, and the most recent here in Evansville a few years before Mary passed on.

This is February 2021. I listen to this song and others and it takes back more than 50 years ago at age 19 on my way to the Vietnam war sailing on a Navy ship and so much uncertainty. Just a kid.  Now I'm 74 years old still listening to all these songs of the 60s. Miss my youth.

I don‚Äôt know what came between these two men, but they can never deny that combined they were gold. And, I love Paul‚Äôs smile.

I'm an Australian who has never been overseas yet every time I hear this song - it makes me long to go to New York and experience what they speak of here. Such a beautiful and timeless song from two men whose music I have been playing lately to my 5 year old twin boys so they can understand what music is and what it should be.

I saw them 12 years ago shortly after they re-reconciled and despite them being older it was the best concert I've been to. Great music, and they each did a solo section in the middle so it was 3 hours of continuous music. They must have enjoyed it themselves as they did a third encore song after the house lights were turned on. Although they were nearly 70 they still had great voices and so many great songs.

The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon & Garfunkel from The Concert in Central Park

Listen to Simon & Garfunkel: https://SimonAndGarfunkel.lnk.to/list...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,This is February 2021. I listen to this song and others and it takes back more than 50 years ago at age 19 on my way to the Vietnam war sailing on a Navy ship and so much uncertainty. Just a kid.  Now I'm 74 years old still listening to all these songs of the 60s. Miss my youth.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"I was at this concert and remember the audience ""singing"" the cymbal crashes. Half a million people imitating a cymbal was surreal. It doesn't come through on the video but it was simply amazing in real life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"Two men, one guitar and only their pure voices...that's magical. Hell yeah, I miss those  days when everything in music is so pure and spiritual.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,Unbelievable how these two sing together as one. In my opinion about the greatest duo ever put together.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,After changes upon changes we hear this music and are forever changed.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4

I don‚Äôt know what came between these two men, but they can never deny that combined they were gold. And, I love Paul‚Äôs smile. I don‚Äôt think either of them aren‚Äôt fully aware of the mark on history this concert and their talents made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4

The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,This totally epic.  You will never see a duet that is so perfect together.  The song writing and their voices was off the charts.  And all they used was a guitar.  That is pure Bliss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,I'm an Australian who has never been overseas yet every time I hear this song - it makes me long to go to New York and experience what they speak of here.

The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"I‚Äôm 65, this is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I can think of. We of our age are blessed. We enjoyed the music of the ‚Äò60s, ‚Äò70s, and ‚Äò80s. I do appreciate the music of today, I‚Äôm not fussy, beautiful music is timeless, but for me, our time presented the best you could hope for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4

The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"I saw them 12 years ago shortly after they re-reconciled and despite them being older it was the best concert I've been to. Great music, and they each did a solo section in the middle so it was 3 hours of continuous music. They must have enjoyed it themselves as they did a third encore song after the house lights were turned on. Although they were nearly 70 they still had great voices and so many great songs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUbFj0BIc4
The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"This is definitely among the top 10 greatest and most poetically beautiful songs ever written and performed.

I feel like a part of me is missing without Tom Petty here. I just saw him in concert in July. He is truly a wonderful person, was still amazing at 66. He spent his entire life doing what he loved, making and performing music. I am very truly sad right now, but if there is a heaven, he's in it for sure.

Tom Petty was my poet. His heart was gold. His music and song danced in my head my whole life like an angel talking to me  watching over me. He was the single most important person who made me love poetry the way I do. Thats the truth. He is love.

I've loved Tom Petty all my life. This song was played at one of my best friends' funeral. He sadly passed at 27. The song, whatever its' meaning may be, still keeps his memory alive every time I hear it. Another aspect of the power of music, really. It will forever make me appreciate my late friend.

this is THE song that I sing everyday at work, to myself, just for myself. I'm 43 now and I realize that I will just be by myself for the rest of my life and this song makes me not only happy about it, but makes me enjoy jumping in my money pit 80's camaro and just cruise when I get off of working second shift.... It's the dream baby.. the dream..

Growing up in the Philly suburbs, senior year 1973 Bruce was the soundtrack of our lives. Every line a direct reference to a place or moment of our lives. It was a bad time for me.............the Boss kept me going and at 65 years old today I'm gonna play one of the anthems of the day (Thunder Road) just so I know I can keep going like I did then and  I can do it now too. Miss you guys (and girls) hanging down on the Pike. Thanks Boss!

My four year old niece who has great taste in music was watching Bruce Springsteen perform this classic song from the ""Born To Run"" album on the Clinton Rally on TV last night and was so mesmerized when she saw him playing the guitar and singing onstage. After watching that performance she just looked up at me and said that she really wants to be a singer-songwriter and musician. I told her that she would need to practice really hard and that I have a red Stratocaster guitar I am gonna let her have as she gets older. Like I said she has great taste in music and loves Bowie, The Stones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys and now Bruce Springsteen.

Saw Bruce, Clarence and the es band in Memphis many years ago. He put on the best show for 2 1/2 hours, took a break and came back for another hour. He had a bucket of water just off the drummer stand.  Every so often he would splash his face and then it was back at it. It was  a job and he did it well...Best night ever

""Someone told me there's a girl out there, with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair""

This line is about Joni Mitchell and this song also receives inspiration from her song California. There's also imagery about Laurel Canyon in this song where Joni Mitchell and other prominent musicians lived.

Lyrics:

Helplessly hoping her harlequin hovers
Nearby awaiting a word
Gasping at glimpses of gentle true spirit
He runs wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of goodbye

Wordlessly watching he waits by the window
And wonders at the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries did he hear a goodbye?
Or even hello?

They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other

Stand by the stairway you'll see something certain
To tell you confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying it's loose in a lady
Who lingers saying she is lost
And choking on hello

They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other

My father loved this song. He played it once and told me about the first time he heard this song. He was a sophomore in high school, he went to his first party that year, at the principals house (hell of a place, right?). Typical 70's party. Beer, weed, and great music. The main thing was that the party holders LOVED Crosby, Stills, and Nash. They had this album playing the entire time. This song always took him back to the first time he heard it, at that party, wishing he could be a kid again.

Watched ""Annihilation"" yesterday and rediscovered this heartbreakingly beautiful song, which I loved first in the very early 70s. Going back thru & listening to the album. The elegant harmonies and simple acoustic guitar...I'm singing along in my creaky old voice. So pleased that a younger generation has been introduced to this timeless song. Such love!

They are like one person - they share the same experiences

Helplessly Hoping - 2005 Remaster,"Crosby, Stills & Nash",I am here for Annihilation. This was the song played while the main character is painting their bedroom wall. Very good music.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyquqw6GeXk
Helplessly Hoping - 2005 Remaster,"Crosby, Stills & Nash",Joel was helplessly hoping for Ellie‚Äôs forgiveness. At least he heard that Ellie was willing to try,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyquqw6GeXk
Helplessly Hoping - 2005 Remaster,"Crosby, Stills & Nash","""But . . . I would like to try.""

Helplessly Hoping - 2005 Remaster,"Crosby, Stills & Nash","My father loved this song. He played it once and told me about the first time he heard this song. He was a sophomore in high school, he went to his first party that year, at the principals house (hell of a place, right?). Typical 70's party. Beer, weed, and great music. The main thing was that the party holders LOVED Crosby, Stills, and Nash. They had this album playing the entire time. This song always took him back to the first time he heard it, at that party, wishing he could be a kid again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyquqw6GeXk
Helplessly Hoping - 2005 Remaster,"Crosby, Stills & Nash","Watched ""Annihilation"" yesterday and rediscovered this heartbreakingly beautiful song, which I loved first in the very early 70s. Going back thru & listening to the album. The elegant harmonies and simple acoustic guitar...I'm singing along in my creaky old voice. So pleased that a younger generation has been introduced to this timeless song. Such love!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyquqw6GeXk
Helplessly Hoping - 2005 Remaster,"Crosby, Stills & Nash","Instantly transported to playing pool with my father with this record on the turntable.

Free together- Before Ellie found out, they loved eachothers company inside",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyquqw6GeXk

It was the first song recorded in a cassete that i gave my girlfriend 33 years ago.
Now I am 57 and she passed away, she left last weekend. I miss her but I still have this song alive here with me. RIP Cassia.

The day I met my future wife, I walked over to ask her to dance and this song came on.  This was the first song we ever danced together.  Translating to Spanish for her as we danced sealed the deal, we were married 6 months later, and 40 years later I still love her.

There are parts of this performance that sound even better than the recorded version. That is one of the things that amazed me when I first saw him in concert. The other artists were not nearly as good live, as they were on their records. Elton was even better.

The guitar is his garden; when he was younger he ran through it, now he is walking at a slower pace, butit  is still his gaden, and he likes tending it. He is Eric Clapton, there is no one like him.

Been listening to this song since it first hit the airwaves, back when I was a much, much younger man.  It still gets me - I was just sitting here listening with my eyes closed, swaying to the melody and the beat.  It has a way of relaxing you.  Thanks, Eric, for all the decades of music  - the music of our lives.

This is how most people wanted Dylan to sing, and he probably could have come close if he had wanted to.  Incidentally, Rafferty could mimic Lennon's voice as well.  Listen to Out of the Blue.

The guy lip syncing isn't Gerry Rafferty. It's his guitarist Joe Egan. Rafferty was gone that day. Rafferty was a genius songwriter. If you like this, look for songs from Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street album. It is one of the best. ""Right Down The Line"" is one of my favorite songs.

This is literally the first ""rock video"" I ever saw. We had just gotten cable television (a big deal in the early '70s) and HBO played these to take up time between movies. It's still one of my very favorite songs of all time. The HBO got turned off after it was discovered they had R-rated movies at night. :-(   üò∏

This Song Around The World version features more than 25 musicians from 12 countries and unites Yusuf / Cat Stevens, singing and playing a beautiful white piano in a tranquil open air setting in Istanbul, Turkey, with musicians such as five time Grammy Award winning blues/americana artist Keb‚Äô Mo‚Äô; Grammy nominated Senegalese artist Baaba Maal; Silkroad‚Äôs Rhiannon Giddens‚Äîalso a Grammy Award winner; Ghassan Birumi playing the oud in Ramallah, Palestine; musicians from the Silkroad Ensemble in Rhinebeck, New York; Pat Simmons (The Doobie Brothers) and James ‚ÄúHutch‚Äù Hutchinson (bass player with Bonnie Raitt) performing in Maui, Hawaii; and bringing together conflict regions with Tushar Lall playing the harmonium in Delhi, India, and Joshua Amjad playing the Kartaal in Karachi, Pakistan.

""Everyone jump upon the Peace Train"" and let's make this world a better place. Happy International Day of Peace. One Love!!!

I was crying a mere 30 seconds in, not only because it was so beautiful to see and hear this song played by so many diverse artists or because I wish so much we could have peace, but because I also remember when this song first came out and it hit me hard just how very little things have changed over the decades since. It feels as if no time has passed, and we‚Äôre older, but not at all wiser. But I still hope for better every single day. Peace. üïäüíô

A tip of the hat to the people who mix these tracks, who take recordings from musicians all over the globe and blend them so seamlessly. The production manages to weave all the performances into a unified whole, where every voice and instrument is heard, and given prominence at the proper time, yet each serves the purpose of serving the song. Our song.

As a lifelong musician for over 60 years, I have always believed and also experienced; that music is truly universal and brings people together. ""Playing for a change"" shows first hand that this belief is alive and well. Thanks to all of the world musicians, artists, sound and visual engineers, and everyone involved who makes this possible through the magic of the internet and their love of the music.

Anybody who cannot shed a tear to this anthem is just not alive. Thank you, Yusuf, for music that transcends generations, and will for generations to come - if we don't destroy ourselves first.

""Ruby Tuesday"" by The Rolling Stones 
Composers: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards 

Lyrics:
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I‚Äôm gonna miss you

Don‚Äôt question why she needs to be so free
She‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôs the only way to be
She just can‚Äôt be chained
To a life where nothing‚Äôs gained
And nothing‚Äôs lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I‚Äôm gonna miss you

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time to lose,‚Äù I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and 
you will lose your mind
Ain‚Äôt life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I‚Äôm gonna miss you

‚ÄúRuby Tuesday (Official Lyric Video)‚Äú
Directed by: Lucy Dawkins and Tom Readdy at Yes Please Productions 
Producers: Julian Klein, Robin Klein, Mick Gochanour

This song is an arrow in my heart. When my daughter left home and was on her own, I played this every day, I couldn't stop myself, and cried every time. ""Don't question why she needs to be so free/She'll tell you it's the only way to be."" It still brings tears - and now SHE is preparing for HER daughter to leave home and be on her own. ""When you change with every new day/Still I'm gonna miss you."" This is just one beautiful song, a masterpiece.

My old dogs name was Ruby, she was born on a Tuesday, we bought her on a Tuesday and for some reason whenever this song came on she looked a little bit happier. When she passed I listened to this song everyday to remember all the happiness in my life to not take anything for granted because it will all be gone one day and on that day you could be dead, alive. So always remember if your having a bad day there is always happiness in something and don't take that happiness for granted.

Composers: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards 

Lyrics:
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I‚Äôm gonna miss you

Don‚Äôt question why she needs to be so free
She‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôs the only way to be
She just can‚Äôt be chained
To a life where nothing‚Äôs gained
And nothing‚Äôs lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I‚Äôm gonna miss you

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time to lose,‚Äù I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and 
you will lose your mind
Ain‚Äôt life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I‚Äôm gonna miss you

LYRICS
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around
About two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing my song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say ""y'all""
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And start playin' again

I'd like to stay
But I might have to go to start over again
I might go back down to Texas
Or go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again

I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers
To questions that I already know
I could build me a castle with memories
Just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes
To get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again, when I know what to say

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around
About two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Play my song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say ""y'all""
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again, when I know what to say

I was heartbroken before he ever sang a word. I was one of those with a ‚Äúhole in his arm where all the money goes‚Äù. I carried Prine around in a  stolen walkman player with a beat up cassette over-due from a library loaned in another state. He spoke pictures of  life folks lived like he knew us personally. Like he lived it himself and had the words that connected with the feelings. But i won‚Äôt miss him,  too much, I‚Äôve got the legacy he‚Äôs left us.  I wish i could tell him ‚Äúthanks‚Äù.

The first time I met John Prine was at a family reunion. I had no idea who he was. Just another cousin I was sharing a six-pack of Fat Tire with, next to a dirty pool at a hotel in the middle of a dry country in Kentucky. It had been the same venue for decades, so locals knew he'd be there.

John prime caused me to play and sing and try to write.  He sure had a way with words. I never got to see him or meet him . I learned a little of his songs, and when I play them for people they tell me it made them happier than they were. With mr prine, a little was a whole lot. Love you john.

LYRICS
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around
About two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing my song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say ""y'all""
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And start playin' again

I'd like to stay
But I might have to go to start over again
I might go back down to Texas
Or go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again

I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers
To questions that I already know
I could build me a castle with memories
Just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes
To get back in the saddle again

I first heard of this song when Mark Steyn wrote about it. Then I listened to it, and realized it reminded me of the film ""the bicycle thief"". People should watch that movie before listening to this. It makes a lot more sense.

This reminds me of Ghislaine Maxwell, who seems to have no more of those glittery friends around. No more trips to Juan les Pins. No more Balmain. No more trips to St. Moritz or the Queen‚Äôs farm.

I saw her about 10 years ago in Durham NC, where I was sitting on the 3rd row.  She was fantastic, but she didn't do this song for the entire regular concert. On her first encore, she still didn't sing it so I stood and called for ""Diamonds and Rust"".....Her second encore ended the same way, and on her third encore, she looked and pointed at me and said ""this is for you"".  :) I still get goose bumps thinking about this.

Lots of guts to bring it all out there - the iconic love story that never made it to the final round. ""You're telling me you're not nostalgic, well - give me another word for it. You were so good with words and at keeping things vague."" Wow. Moves me every time.

Besides being utterly beautiful, ""Diamonds and Rust"" is among the most haunting, nakedly honest autobiographical songs ever recorded. Most of us have had the experience at one time or another of having an old lover suddenly appear out of nowhere, leaving us feeling, for a time at least, shattered, confused, and conflicted. But no one I can think of has ever captured that experience better than Baez did in this song. It also nails the vibe of New York City on a cold autumn day. This is poetry/songwriting at its very best.

This clip is a masterpiece. It hits deep in the soul and emotions portraying a refugee's drama. From the time the person leaves their homeland, the separation from family, the lonely endless and dangerous trips, until the time they finally arrive at ""Mars"" (representing a totally different environment, cold as hell, no help and no love lost).

I just heard this song for the first time the other day. Being a huge Beatles fan, I am surprised at myself for missing out of this great track.  If this is any indication of what the rest of the album sounds like, it must be one of Paul's best efforts in a long, long time.

The opening cut, ""The Song we Were Singing"" is very Beatle-esque, and is one of the best songs on Flaming Pie. This disc feels caught between The Beatles and Latte McCartney to me.  I like it, but love his stuff that if pre-1980.

Here is a version of this sung, done partly at a campfire in the woods and in the studio with Linda. I love it!  https://youtu.be/I7ylihrF2GE?t=3298  There has never been, in my opinion, a better overall musician (songwriter/singer/instrumentalist/percussionist/whistler, etc., etc.).  The man is simply musical!

I find it interesting to see how she's performed this song through the years. Comparing this brighter, funkier version with the slower, more soul-driven version she performs now, it's clear that this song has changed with her as she's aged. I think it's a beautiful thing to see and hear.

I hope there's some demo tape I haven't heard out there of the ORIGINAL original version of this song; the 'Mrs. Roosevelt' version.

What's really interesting is that the song, in any shape or form, has literally nothing to do with the character of the same name in the film; the song is clearly describing a GOOD woman. This is probably a holdover from the original ""Mrs. Roosevelt"" theme.

One of the true masters of the acoustic guitar, if quality of work had anything to do with album sales, Thompson would be a billionaire.

I've always loved this song but I felt it needed another verse, so in the spirit of the ""folk process"" I've written one.
Come down young James, said Red Molly, it's your 17th year

There's breakfast on the table and a story to hear

One of the last times I saw my ex-husband (with whom I parted on friendly terms over a decade ago) was when I invited him and his girlfriend to see RT play live a few years ago. When he ended the show with this song, I glanced over at my ex and saw him  literally wiping tears from his eyes.

This is the best single person performance recording of all time. He wrote it, sings with fantastic inflection, and the guitar action is other-worldly with layers I might never understand.  A master craftsman at work, and recorded for our enjoyment. Thanks.

Every time I hear Richard play this wonderful song, I am left speechless over the lack of recognition of one of the greatest guitarists alive today.

That Song hits me every time i hear it. And there is no better Version than the original by Richard Thompson! 
No Sean Rowe, Mc Coury and Reckless Kelly won't do, they don't have the soul like a Vincent 52 :)

My grandpa passed away last week. 
In my memory he is mostly just bushy eyebrows, an amazing silver-tinted beard, and a booming resonant voice.
But in his young days in England he owned a Vincent Black Shadow, and migrated to Australia on a Velocette via Europe, India, Kashmir, Pakistan and Southeast Asia.

Brilliant!   A '52 Vincent would have no keys to give... but this marvelous tune holds one of the best lines in music history regarding fate.   As far as the ""thumbs down"" count, it just goes to show there are 27 (to date) soul less clods in the world. A shame they walk the earth with their eyes, ears... and hearts closed.   /Brakelate/

Wow  wow wow! Why have I never looked this up on YouTube? My dear brother, now gone from this world, introduced me to this song and outstanding guitarist 11 years ago. I play it often, but never witnessed how amazing Richard Thompson is to watch. 
It‚Äôs a breathtaking song. Love love love it. Thank you, Richard ‚ù§Ô∏è

Brings tears to my eyes.  I've never owned a Vincent but I once had an old Triumph and I get the emotional connection. In fact, my Dad's dream machines were ""Vincent/HRD"" and Brough Superior.  Although he never owned either of them, he had an Ariel and he's been with the angels since 1974. (WIpes eyes and scolds self for being so soft).  An amazing song.

1952 Vincent Black Lightning,Richard Thompson,"My grandpa passed away last week. 
In my memory he is mostly just bushy eyebrows, an amazing silver-tinted beard, and a booming resonant voice.

A shame they walk the earth with their eyes, ears... and hearts closed.   /Brakelate/",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0kJdrfzjAg
1952 Vincent Black Lightning,Richard Thompson,"Wow  wow wow! Why have I never looked this up on YouTube? My dear brother, now gone from this world, introduced me to this song and outstanding guitarist 11 years ago. I play it often, but never witnessed how amazing Richard Thompson is to watch.

1952 Vincent Black Lightning,Richard Thompson,"Brings tears to my eyes.  I've never owned a Vincent but I once had an old Triumph and I get the emotional connection. In fact, my Dad's dream machines were ""Vincent/HRD"" and Brough Superior.  Although he never owned either of them, he had an Ariel and he's been with the angels since 1974.

John was my next-door neighbour here in Ireland for over 10 years up to his passing. He lived in the house I grew up in. John was a wonderful talent and a wonderful man. He funeral was the most beautiful one I've ever been to

My Brother died January 2011. I played and sang this to him at his funeral in Exeter. He was always a good strong brother to me and he knows that I loved him so. I chose this song because I learnt and played it for him for his last birthday a few months earlier. John Martyn was a wonderful songwriter. RIP

Incredible performance. How he balances his voice and the guitar through a really wide dynamic range, his mic technique and phrasing is perfect. This is one of the best versions I've heard.

Saw him 3 or 4 times in the 80s, mostly in Stoke.  He was superb every time and now my 23 year old is into him too. You were a genius John,  and this song is just  beautiful. Thank you for touching our hearts and souls

this is te only song in all of history that i feel like is magic, it literally feels like he is casting a spell. ""yes to dance beneath the diamond sky, with one hand waving free""  that line brings me to tears every time. tears from the absolute joy of it. it is a metaphor, for everything that is great, it represents true absolute freedom, it represents the unbridled exuberance of youth, it represents all the wonder and the joy of existence and infinity of the quest for knowledge.

This song helped me get through a really rough time
From April to June I was a ""Locally Stranded Individual"", stuck by myself in the capital (Manila) far from my hometown, from my family, friends, and girlfriend. I hadn't cried so much during that time since my grandfather passed away two years ago

Dylan was a genius from the start. The beetles started with simpleton type stuff like ""She loves you yeah yeah yeah"" and ""I want to hold your hand"" It amazes me how a band with that mindset could evolve to produce the more complex albums that they made.

Artist  Bread  
Song The Guitar Man 
Album Guitar Man 
Year 1972 

Bread's GUITAR MAN was not one of its most commercially successful albums--the album's only chart single was the title track--but it's a finely-crafted, well-constructed soft rock album which shows the group at its best. Bandleader David Gates first made his name as a session producer and songwriter in mid-'60s L.A.; the Monkees' hard-pop ""Saturday's Child"" is one of his best and best-known efforts.

He clearly learned at the feet of such icons as Brian Wilson and Phil Spector, as even the weaker songs here are sublimely arranged, with crystalline production. The best songs, such as ""Welcome to the Music"" or ""I Didn't Even Know Her Name,"" are comparable to the best of the Carpenters' singles being released at the same time.

I was seven when this song came out. It reminds me of summer days in the park that always included barbecue and leaving in the evening tired and happy. This song would be on the radio and I listened as the night wind blew through the open windows of our station wagon. Such simple and memorable times.

I was at primary school when this album was released. I used to sleep with a transistor radio under my pillow. I had a fantastic dream one night that I was walking through the school playground playing the guitar to this song. I woke up and this song was playing on the radio. I will never forget the great feeling that I had during that dream, it was so real.

Guitar Man,Bread,"Artist  Bread  
Song The Guitar Man 
Album Guitar Man 
Year 1972 

Bread's GUITAR MAN was not one of its most commercially successful albums--the album's only chart single was the title track--but it's a finely-crafted, well-constructed soft rock album which shows the group at its best. Bandleader David Gates first made his name as a session producer and songwriter in mid-'60s L.A.; the Monkees' hard-pop ""Saturday's Child"" is one of his best and best-known efforts.

He clearly learned at the feet of such icons as Brian Wilson and Phil Spector, as even the weaker songs here are sublimely arranged, with crystalline production. The best songs, such as ""Welcome to the Music"" or ""I Didn't Even Know Her Name,"" are comparable to the best of the Carpenters' singles being released at the same time.

Guitar Man,Bread,I was seven when this song came out. It reminds me of summer days in the park that always included barbecue and leaving in the evening tired and happy.

this song saved my life. i was going through a tough time at school and i had no one. i was constantly bullied, punched and called homophobic slurs. i'd always come home and just isolate myself in my room and just cry. George Harrison's music was the light that lighted my world and i am forever grateful and thankful for what that man has done to my life. i'm currently in a much better place now and  i've made some amazing friends. it is true all things must pass!

My ex-husband was a huge Beatles fan.  He knew every word to every song on every album and had a big collection of vinyl albums. It's one of the things that made me fall in love with him.  He was the love of my life.  But he was a hopeless alcoholic and I reached a point I could no longer live with it.  After our divorce, he moved to an apartment a few blocks away and I continued to help him as the disease was slowly killing him.  In the end, I found him deceased in his apartment.  When I went to clean it out,  on his turntable was the album ""All Things Must Pass"".  I know that was a final message to me.  RIP Chuck and George.

Lost my dad this morning. Despite battling Stage 4 Lymphoma, he suddenly passed away during the night.  It hurts so much. He was not only my father, he was my idol, I was his record-hunting wingman. He was my best friend.  I hope wherever you are now, that your journey is a safe one. I love you and will miss you always.

They've done a really good job in bringing George's voice to the forefront by removing the echo. I can't wait to hear the rest. For the record, I never minded the wall-of-sound of the original mix. It was the version I grew up with as I first heard it in '70.  Best Beatle solo album. Period. Not to lessen Lennon's Plastic Ono Band or say, Band on the Run but ATMP is a stunner.  George was THE BEST Beatle. Just my opinion, though.

This song gives me hope in my saddest and toughest times, it tells me to stay strong even if everything is falling apart, it tells me that everything is bound to pass and one day I will be able to smile again because I'll be genuinely happy. Even if you're not here with us anymore, your songs are still able to make people cry, smile and think.

It's interesting how the song begins with a reminder on how our happiness can be replaced with sadness without warning.
But then the song also immediately reminds us that said sadness can also be replaced by happiness.

'love one another' ~ were his last words. 
George Harrison was magic. His music is magic. Lifts me high up yet brings me back to the ground. Shows me the divinity in the process of living, albeit the insignificance. I wish more people look up about him as the individual he grew into post-Beatles era and see for themselves the things they'll learn. The art of

The best song from George,  by far imo.  This song sums up this amazing man creativity and search for what's beyond this earthly life.  Thank goodness George came along in my lifetime.  Olivia said George wanted his songs to have staying power, mission accomplished and then some.

All Things Must Pass - 2020 Mix,George Harrison,"My ex-husband was a huge Beatles fan.  He knew every word to every song on every album and had a big collection of vinyl albums. It's one of the things that made me fall in love with him.  He was the love of my life.  But he was a hopeless alcoholic and I reached a point I could no longer live with it.  After our divorce, he moved to an apartment a few blocks away and I continued to help him as the disease was slowly killing him.  In the end, I found him deceased in his apartment.  When I went to clean it out,  on his turntable was the album ""All Things Must Pass"".  I know that was a final message to me.  RIP Chuck and George.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWV4pFV5nX4

I listened to an interview with Suzanne. She and Leonard never had sexual relationship. Though she said, ""He was a very seductive man."" They were very close, for how long is unclear. 
Leonard's father stressed reading the classics. So he  was very cognizant of the powerful nature of the muse. Suzanne said, ""What we had was more intimate than a sexual relationship. If we had sex, we would have lost that.""

I've been listening to Leonard Cohen for over 50 years. This was the first album of his that I bought, and I couldn't get enough of it - I played it over and over. It has never dated, it has always remained relevant; fifty years on, it is still as moving and hauntingly beautiful as it ever was.

I remember watching a documentary about a homeless man from Montreal who knew Leonard Cohen. This man ended up in the west of Canada, in Vancouver, and ultimately in a mental hospital. He needed cash for cigarettes or something, and told the nurses ""please call my friend Leonard Cohen and ask him to send me some money"". The nurses probably thought he was lying, but they called anyway. Leonard sent this guy some money!

This is the song that got me into Leonard's catalogue. That one line section ""And when he knew for certain/Only drowning men could see him/He said ""All men will be sailors then/Until the sea shall free them'/But he himself was broken/Long before the sky would open/Forsaken, almost human/He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone"" absolutely blew my mind. I couldn't believe such an expression could be put across in a matter of a few lines. I later saw Leonard perform in Australia what was one of his last shows ever. 3 hours of playing, dancing, singing, running across the stage and getting down on his knees - all at 79 years of age. What a blessing to have witnessed that with my own eyes. I may have missed out on seeing Jimi Hendrix tripped out on LSD burn his guitar, Keith Moon and Pete Townshend smash their instruments or Charly Garc√≠a playing the piano and synthesizer at the same time whilst laying across his piano stool, a rose in his teeth, screaming metaphorical lyrics at the government who wanted him dead, but I did get to see Leonard Cohen and that's enough for me.

Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,I was named after this song ...my Dad listened to it every day the year before I was born and then the night I was born...I listen to it when I'm missing  him.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"I‚Äôm a 14 year old girl who randomly found this song and now can‚Äôt stop listening to it. I‚Äôm crying, it‚Äôs so beautiful. I hope everyone‚Äôs having a fantastic day and enjoying this one :)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"I listened to an interview with Suzanne. She and Leonard never had sexual relationship. Though she said, ""He was a very seductive man."" They were very close, for how long is unclear. 
Leonard's father stressed reading the classics. So he  was very cognizant of the powerful nature of the muse. Suzanne said, ""What we had was more intimate than a sexual relationship. If we had sex, we would have lost that."" ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,Who's still listening july 2021 to this masterpiece from the legend that was Leonard Cohen truly amazing.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"I've been listening to Leonard Cohen for over 50 years. This was the first album of his that I bought, and I couldn't get enough of it - I played it over and over. It has never dated, it has always remained relevant; fifty years on, it is still as moving and hauntingly beautiful as it ever was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"I remember watching a documentary about a homeless man from Montreal who knew Leonard Cohen. This man ended up in the west of Canada, in Vancouver, and ultimately in a mental hospital. He needed cash for cigarettes or something, and told the nurses ""please call my friend Leonard Cohen and ask him to send me some money"". The nurses probably thought he was lying, but they called anyway. Leonard sent this guy some money!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,This song is hauntingly beautiful.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"After listening to this song 300 times, I have no doubt In my mind: this is the most beautiful song ever written",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,This really is the best song I've ever heard in my life.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
Suzanne,Leonard Cohen,"This is the song that got me into Leonard's catalogue. That one line section ""And when he knew for certain/Only drowning men could see him/He said ""All men will be sailors then/Until the sea shall free them'/But he himself was broken/Long before the sky would open/Forsaken, almost human/He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone"" absolutely blew my mind. I couldn't believe such an expression could be put across in a matter of a few lines. I later saw Leonard perform in Australia what was one of his last shows ever. 3 hours of playing, dancing, singing, running across the stage and getting down on his knees - all at 79 years of age. What a blessing to have witnessed that with my own eyes. I may have missed out on seeing Jimi Hendrix tripped out on LSD burn his guitar, Keith Moon and Pete Townshend smash their instruments or Charly Garc√≠a playing the piano and synthesizer at the same time whilst laying across his piano stool, a rose in his teeth, screaming metaphorical lyrics at the government who wanted him dead, but I did get to see Leonard Cohen and that's enough for me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svitEEpI07E
