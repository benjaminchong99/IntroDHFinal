I saw Linkin Park trending on Twitter yesterday, and I thought maybe they had released a new song. So curious me clicked the link and realized they were trending because Chester died. It felt like my world just stopped. His music helped me get through middle school and High School. His voice was special. And it's a shame that he had so much pain that he thought suicide was the answer. I hope he's at peace now, but I am really going to miss hearing him sing.

One of the most original bands ever. I mean, they developed a style and sound that literally no one could steal because it is all theirs and theirs alone.

This song for some reason resonates so hard with me, with the verses being spoken word with a looping riff, and then the chorus is a lot more musical. Currently this masterpiece is carrying me through high-school, and I hope it continues to do so.

my dad used to listen to this song (and a lot of other RHCP songs, too). Fast forward to late 2021, I hear this in the ""Don't you lecture me with your thirty dollar haircut!"" animation. I felt a wave of nostalgia upon hearing this after not being able to remember the lyrics for my entire life up to that point. Love this song, always have, always will.

I had a friend in elementary school who loved Green Day. We were strangers at first but got to know each other because she sat in my group table, a year or so passed and so did she. I never knew how she died and nobody told me because I was just a kid. Every time I think of her I come here and listen to this song, the only Green Day song she introduced me to. I am 21 now and still remember her from time to time...R.I.P Jenny I will never forget a good, funny admirable person like her

This song is very obsessive ... I can't stop listening to it ... It gives me a feeling of inexplicable but pleasant nostalgia ... :) ... Listening to this with headphones at full volume those lyrics with an apocalyptic sense. I enter another world ... It's just amazing ...

There's so much emotion in that solo - an almost pleading, begging, unrequited love situation just emanate from the guitar...quite incredible!

Hysteria will be, according to lots of people, the best song of Muse, and I can't disagree.

So what if it's ''emo'' like my friends say? It's Muse, their experimental. The bass line, the guitar that sounds like a DJ rolling a disk or smth, that's REALLY CLEVER. The music video is oh man, expensive yet must've been satisifying. The part after

Recently went to a Killswitch Engage show, and Chop Suey! was played in the background before August Burns Red hit the stage. And believe me when I say EVERY FUCKING PERSON in the venue sang this with all their might and it was the most fucking magical moment to experience. Arguably the best part of the whole show and SOAD wasn‚Äôt even performing.

This band and their thought provoking inspirational music, really shaped a young me.

Actually I was the freak in a sea of Hollister and Ambercrombie & Fitch npc's.

Fun fact. This track was originally called Suicide but the label pressured them to change it. If you shorten Suicide it becomes Sui so it's Chopped. Hence Chop Suey! That's why Serj says ""we're rolling Suicide"" just as the track starts on the album version. The more you know...

When he adds a little growl in the note, it can be so subtle, but singing along and adding those inflections is difficult!!!

Fun fact. This track was originally called Suicide but the label pressured them to change it. If you shorten Suicide it becomes Sui so it's Chopped. Hence Chop Suey! That's why Serj says ""we're rolling Suicide"" just as the track starts on the album version. The more you know...

The 60s psychedelic garage rock vibe is strong in this one. Love the Fuzz distortion, that's when it really hits. The bass tone was played on a 1960's Kay Hollowbody guitar. Long live the 60s I say. It never left.

Love this song! Seven Nation Army came out about a month shy of my 15th birthday. Just turned 34 a bit over a week ago.
A timeless classic tune from the early 2000s that rivals the stuff from the late 60's and 70's.
Music really peaked in the 90s and the early to mid 2000s. Even the best independent stuff from the 2010s and 20s cannot hold a candle to this.

As I get older, these songs that I listen to when I was a teenager are starting to resonate as I cross the same bridges these artists once crossed.  When I was younger I liked the sound and thought it was catchy but now these songs have become higher resolution in my mind and I listen to the lyrics and the meanings more than I once did. It is scary in a sense.

When people say this songs makes people feel better people don‚Äôt realise that this was written after he found out he was being cheated on, so he made a draft that night and most of the lyrics weren‚Äôt changed as he wanted it to be as close to how he felt in that moment as he could, so at one of this legends lowest times he made a song that will be timeless and I have full respect and hope that this will never be forgotten

One of the best overplayed songs ever that ACTUALLY deserves to be overplayed. Also, during the 2021 college football season, the Michigan Wolverines used this as their anthem from beating Ohio State for the first time since 2011 to winning their first B1G Championship Game ever (1st conference title since 2004 and first outright conference championship since 2003). It's a pretty cool anthem for a team like Michigan, but it's not the first song from the 2000s Big Blue made an anthem for them.

I'll never forget my first time listening to this song. Weird time in my life, starting to get older and see the world for what it really is, and also start to appreciate the earlier years a little more, and eventually I landed on this in the middle of the night. Idk how to really describe it, it was one of those moments where I find something and I'm just like ""my god....how did I go this far in my life without listening to this?"" The vibe and charm of this song will forever make it timeless, it's magical

This is one of those songs that if a person doesn‚Äôt like it they generally have something wrong with them. It‚Äôs so good that I would generally go to there concert to see them play it even though I don‚Äôt know any of there other music. Like it‚Äôs just so good. I would say one of the best songs ever released.

It's 14th February, 3.52 AM.. Although I've known this song since I was a teen, I was reminded of it while watching The Holiday today. It makes me think of someone I love but can't tell, or be with. Not in immense pain at this very moment, but the the intensity of the yearning comes and goes. Easier to confess to strangers.

Mr. Brightside,The Killers,"This song is forever amazing, whoever is going through tough times I hope you can find peace and get through it..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE
Mr. Brightside,The Killers,"When people say this songs makes people feel better people don‚Äôt realise that this was written after he found out he was being cheated on, so he made a draft that night and most of the lyrics weren‚Äôt changed as he wanted it to be as close to how he felt in that moment as he could, so at one of this legends lowest times he made a song that will be timeless and I have full respect and hope that this will never be forgotten",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE
Mr. Brightside,The Killers,This song is easily one of the VERY BEST rock songs to come out in the years between 2000 and 2010. Straight up it really is!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE
Mr. Brightside,The Killers,One of my best friends passed away one year ago today. 19 years old when he died. We were on the high school swim team together and after every meet we would scream sing this song on the bus ride back. This reminds me of him more than I could imagine. I know I‚Äôll be coming back here often,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE

Mr. Brightside,The Killers,A true masterpiece. A remnant from the time where music was neither classic nor modern.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE
Mr. Brightside,The Killers,"One of the best overplayed songs ever that ACTUALLY deserves to be overplayed. Also, during the 2021 college football season, the Michigan Wolverines used this as their anthem from beating Ohio State for the first time since 2011 to winning their first B1G Championship Game ever (1st conference title since 2004 and first outright conference championship since 2003). It's a pretty cool anthem for a team like Michigan, but it's not the first song from the 2000s Big Blue made an anthem for them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE
Mr. Brightside,The Killers,"I'll never forget my first time listening to this song. Weird time in my life, starting to get older and see the world for what it really is, and also start to appreciate the earlier years a little more, and eventually I landed on this in the middle of the night. Idk how to really describe it, it was one of those moments where I find something and I'm just like ""my god....how did I go this far in my life without listening to this?""

I think it's a crime that today is the first time I hear this song. Especially since I am 30 and I used to know all the bands from early 2000s. Wow bring me back to those times where the music was actually good. Not all that rap/pop crap we hear today full of cursing and promoting nasty things. People have dumbed down in the past 10 years.

This was a special song between my dad and me. He died last year Sept. 2. The day before his funeral, I drove to the cemetery to see exactly where the service would be the next day. (It‚Äôs a large military cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.) As I drove in, this song came on the radio, and it felt like him finding a way to reach out to me. Not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt miss him.

Serious question: Why did this music just go away? Alternative rock from the 90s to around mid 2000s was amazing, and it just seemingly died overnight. People would still listen to music like this now.

For me, this song is a bittersweet memory: it always takes me back to being a young teenager, watching my grampie fade away with Louis body dementia, and my grammie, steadfast by his side, with unwavering love.  They taught me so much about love and life; 20 plus years later and I still think of them everyday.

This was my favorite song of all time when it came out when I was 3rd grade. Guess what? Still 100% checks out. Guitar work is so tight, emotion behind the vocals, I know straight up rock has not been popular for a long time and despite all of my hipster/indie leanings I will ALWAYS appreciate 3 Doors Down. I still think they're good.

Although this song was released in 2000, it still reminds me of the end of the best decade EVER.  Best songs, best rave and party nights, super great time to be alive and Canadians were proud of who they were, the list goes on and on.  Sure, there were some bad things and struggles, but the energy from everyone was electric and f_cking fantastic.  Miss that decade SOOO much.

A year ago, I was listening to this song on my computer when my friend called me with the news that our teammate had gotten into a horrible accident. As a teenager, that rocked my world. I was close with him- we were expecting that teammate to lead us as a captain through the hectic COVID sports season. I later found out that he had lost his leg and for weeks on end this song haunted me. No matter what I did, it continued to play in my head. I went on extremely long runs with it ringing through my ears; it‚Äôs what drove me to step up and take change in his absence.

Kryptonite,3 Doors Down,I think it's a crime that today is the first time I hear this song. Especially since I am 30 and I used to know all the bands from early 2000s. Wow bring me back to those times where the music was actually good. Not all that rap/pop crap we hear today full of cursing and promoting nasty things. People have dumbed down in the past 10 years.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPU8OAjjS4k

The day before his funeral, I drove to the cemetery to see exactly where the service would be the next day. (It‚Äôs a large military cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.)

I later found out that he had lost his leg and for weeks on end this song haunted me. No matter what I did, it continued to play in my head.

I'm an old guy.  The last 10-15 years or so, I've been a bit underwhelmed by many music groups.  This was the first song I every heard by Fall Out Boy.  I immediately knew the young kids can still rock.  I'm now a huge fan of this group.  As long as young kids are making music like this...I have hope.  Great band.

Ahhh, yes. The Mid 2000's high school vibes. They used to play this on the various music video stations every single day before school(before YouTube). I was always more into metal like Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, As I lay Dying, Trivium, Etc.. but something about fallout boy just caught my ear. So many Great memories (including some of my best friends) come to mind when I hear this song. It genuinely transports me back in time. Music is beautiful and powerful in that way. If you're reading this - I hope it does the same for you!

I'm a black mother who raised my kids in a mostly black neighborhood and my black punker son who's 28 and has always listened and prefer rock & heavy metal music since the age of 5 yrs old had gotten me hooked on Fall out boy and other rock and heavy metal music . I told him in spite of teens and my other 3 adult kids who were hip hop and R&B not to change who he was. I told him that just because you're black doesn't mean you have to like R&B and hip hop . Ppl respect the real you. At 22yrs later  he's still never had any problem in our mostly black neighborhood .Just thought I'd share something good. Be yourself. Support who your kids are as long as it's positive. Yes I rocked this song in my car hard for yrs üòÇüòÇ Have a safe good night everyone.

Despite being a pretentious prog metal snob, I always loved this song. Very colorful music with a great melody and lyrical flow, way better than other pop punk emo stuff going on at the time. The issue was that every track on the whole dam album sounded almost exactly the same! It's not the ideas, its the formulaic approach.

I still remember when this came out and it was the new, Fall Out Boy, because I picked up ""Take This To Your Grave"", when it came out, and was already a fan - I saw it at whatever store was before FYE...wasn't Sam Goody... but I grabbed it on a whim and it was a solid choice.
  This came out when I was 18. I'll never forget those days. I saw Fall Out Boy at Warped Tour 2005 (?, I am pretty sure it was that year) and it was insane, how many bands were at that festival...I'm replaying it in my head...remembering how damn thirsty, I was, all day and those crazy lines for water but also, that every good emo/pop-punk band was there. I walked behind, Andrew and his GF, after the FOB set, for about a minute and his shirt was off and you could see his back tattoos that he had gotten, semi-recently (I think he didn't have them during the TTTYG era, if I'm not mistaken).    Great times, can't go back but I'll be keeping the memories for as long as I can.

""We're going daa daa ina ealia raaaa and sugaaa were gaaa daa swinging"" 
And I used to think those were the actual lyrics. I would sing that at like 8 years old not knowing who it was by or what song it was, just the lyrics stuck with me throughout these years.

I'm 18 but forever grateful for my older cousins to introduce me to the Fall Out Boy and all 2000s music as a kid during their rock and emo phase.

I miss the simple music videos of the 2000s, something so nostalgic about them. No high tech fancy stuff, the music is enough

"Sugar, We're Goin Down",Fall Out Boy,I'm a black mother who raised my kids in a mostly black neighborhood and my black punker son who's 28 and has always listened and prefer rock & heavy metal music since the age of 5 yrs old had gotten me hooked on Fall out boy and other rock and heavy metal music . I told him in spite of teens and my other 3 adult kids who were hip hop and R&B not to change who he was. I told him that just because you're black doesn't mean you have to like R&B and hip hop . Ppl respect the real you. At 22yrs later  he's still never had any problem in our mostly black neighborhood .Just thought I'd share something good. Be yourself.

  This came out when I was 18. I'll never forget those days. I saw Fall Out Boy at Warped Tour 2005 (?, I am pretty sure it was that year) and it was insane, how many bands were at that festival...I'm replaying it in my head...remembering how damn thirsty, I was, all day and those crazy lines for water but also, that every good emo/pop-punk band was there. I walked behind, Andrew and his GF, after the FOB set, for about a minute and his shirt was off and you could see his back tattoos that he had gotten, semi-recently (I think he didn't have them during the TTTYG era, if I'm not mistaken).    Great times, can't go back but I'll be keeping the memories for as long as I can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhG-vLZrb-g

It's the evolution of music with some icons combined.  I think the third one is not Hendrix alone (maybe a mix of two guys). That hair metal band is definitely Poison. Awesome video and song... Long live the chilies.

Stadium Arcadium came out on my third birthday. That album, specifically the singles, take me back to that time. I miss the early 2000's but it's nice to know that my favourite band of all time is still going, with my favourite guitarist, and that even though the worlds gone to complete shit, I can still find comfort in pleasures like this. God bless you all and have an excellent day.

It breaks my heart that Paramore won't play this banger live anymore. I'm not much of a fan of their post-2014 music. I saw them live in 2014 and 2018 and it was shortly after that that Hayley Williams announced Misery Business won't be played anymore because they don't feel it represents who they are anymore.

It's really depressing when you know that basically no one in your school has the same music taste as you. You can't really share any music with them or talk about the same amazing bands like Green Day. Sometimes I wish Green Day was mainstream again, but sadly there's nothing I can do about it, and till then I walk alone.

Gotta give props to these guys.  They sound just as good live as they did recorded.  A lot of big bands can't play well live to save their skins.  This is a great song, by the way.

This was when mental illness and abuse was embarrassing to say and it wasn't talked about like today. If the adults at that time instead of listening to the lyrics they focused and only heard the anger in the music, the voice. We were teens pre-teens who had no way of safely express ourselves.

It‚Äôs awesome when your cry for help gets answered. My band has had my back over these years, and my friends and my family. That song is timeless and it connects with who we are today and what we do today in a major way.""

Hope you're in a better place.

I was a huge blink fan growing up but by the time this album came out I had drifted away.  in my thirties now, I've come back to blink a fair amount, especially for Travis' playing and appreciating the musicianship.  I just listened to this song again randomly and am reading people's stories and was just struck with a visceral physical heartbreak.  Realizing the passage of time.  Realizing that 2009 was 13 years ago... Knowing the friends I lost to suicide, addiction and the simple parting of ways that occurs naturally as characters who were irreplaceable suddenly are missing and irrelevant.  Love to anyone here, using music as a balm, as a doorway to another time, as a tether to the people you can't reach and a time you can only associate with by withering memory.  I make my own music now, and have for a long time... and I hope people will bond with it and over it in the way music has helped so many.  Be well ya'll.

Somebody I loved a decade ago always said this song reminded him of me. I wouldn't love Blink - 182 without him. He passed Saturday. So today I cry for him and I remember him by listening to this.

I Miss You,blink-182,"I was a huge blink fan growing up but by the time this album came out I had drifted away.  in my thirties now, I've come back to blink a fair amount, especially for Travis' playing and appreciating the musicianship.  I just listened to this song again randomly and am reading people's stories and was just struck with a visceral physical heartbreak.  Realizing the passage of time.  Realizing that 2009 was 13 years ago... Knowing the friends I lost to suicide, addiction and the simple parting of ways that occurs naturally as characters who were irreplaceable suddenly are missing and irrelevant.  Love to anyone here, using music as a balm, as a doorway to another time, as a tether to the people you can't reach and a time you can only associate with by withering memory.  I make my own music now, and have for a long time... and I hope people will bond with it and over it in the way music has helped so many.  Be well ya'll.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1tAYmMjLdY

Musically, I wouldn't call this song emo/pop-punk at all. This is classic rock all the way. The blend of major and minor licks in the solo, the rhythm of the I IV V chords in the verse.. This is MCR tackling what got them into music in the first place, blues rock!! I've loved this song since I was a little kid listening to Black Parade on my portable CD player. Music never dies

This song has a permanent place in my music lists. I like the message of the song and the way it is conveyed. 
But I've just seen the music video for the first time ... after an initial shock, I think the contrast to the lyrics is actually quite good

I never heard these guys before. As a boomer born in the early 50's I grew up on the Beatles. As a teen it was Cream, Hendrix, Deep Purple. Then moved on to Led Zeppelin, Van Halen , AC/DC and Rush. Now as I near 70, I can add System of a Down to my favorite metal bands. These guys rock. You're never too old to appreciate great music.

The thing about SOAD is that their songs go from intense and then cuts out for like two seconds then immediately gets back into it. That‚Äôs what I like about their music. And I imagine it takes crazy talent to be able to sing super intensely then sing really softly. Love SOAD

I grew up listening to rap my whole life. I am 25 and JUST now getting into rock. I wish i would have listened to this band earlier. I guess i never gave it a chance until now.

This song is definitely 1 of the best songs of this talented band. Jared Leto is at his best, as is the rest of the band. The cinematography is fantastic, and ""The Shining"" theme uniquely creative.  ""The Kill"" carries a strong message about the difficult but necessary step we need to take to total self acceptance, flaws and all. Terribly difficult indeed.

Fuckkk I miss this so much. I remember having a playlist with 30 seconds to mars, my chemical romance, fall out boy, panic! at the disco, evanescence, paramore... Let's just say the basic emo playlist  
It was sooo beautiful, this kind of music has no comparison, it was just simply amazing.

Was crying from an anxiety attack so I listened to this. Still crying, but it's from relief now instead of anxiety. This song feels like it reaches into my heart and scoops out all the bad feelings. I won't say it cured my depression and anxiety, but it was definitely a puff of fresh air from the stifling emotions.

I used to dislike this song in my teens- then I ended a long term relationship a few yrs ago and just now in 2022 thinking about my 40th birthday it brought me good vibes and positive thoughts... now one of my favorite songs after all that life has put me through- lost my kids in a custody battle in 2011, was homeless in 2012 as a result, broke up with the love of my life 5 yrs ago, and now, living alone and loving life after all it has given me... thank you for this!!!

This song kept me alive when I was younger and specifically in middle school. It‚Äôs been interesting to see how my emotional responses have changed to it as I‚Äôve gotten older. Now I‚Äôm so grateful I pushed through it all. Music really has the power to heal and save

This song changed so much for me when I was a awkward teen.    The lyrics. It hit me deeply and everything was alright. Now I am a grown ass woman and I am on top of the world. Thanks Jimmy Eat World.

So my mom really liked Panic! At the Disco's cover of Into the Unknown from Frozen 2. It surprised me since I didn't think my mom liked covers like that. So I decided to show her this song... and she actually liked it! Showed her a few others through the band's years but she liked this the most.

Growing up in the 2000s as a teen was just amazing, the music we had and overall the culture. Played this in the way to freshman of high school, MTV then was iconic, the movies then, our outfits and flip phones - 2000s youth culture was something else, kids now missed it. I can see why the generation now also is bringing back 2000s trends and wants to be like teens then, the 2000s music is still going strong even more than now

Durst deserves so much more respect than hes given. Seems cool as fuck in every interview... even when hes being trashed on he holds it together. Your hatred only makes his lyrics that much more real. At least he did his part to attack bullying. Probably be alot less school shootings if we had more music that the bullied can embrace. Music was everyrhing to me in those tough years. I still revert back to slipknot, korn, manson, limp bizkit to get me through shit. Today the ""nobody"" kids have no one to look up to like We did growing up. So after all that said thank you Mr. Durst

March 2022 and this song is still an absolute banger!!! My son's mother and I used to always jam to this song and Rise Against before we broke up and this woman literally did save me when it felt like there wasn't anything to save but she built me up and gave me hope and always had my back and still does....ironic enough her and I are back together after 3 year's apart and thing's couldn't be better!! Nostalgic is an understatement but when we listen to this while together it's like nothing ever changed!!! Fucking epic on a different level.....this song is

This song is absolutely remarkable. I've been listening to this song for years and I only just realized how universal and varied these lyrics are. Supposedly the video is about forgiveness and the way the republican party treats environmental issues and endangered animals, but it also works as a great love song. It's super versatile. There are many Rise Against songs that have more powerful lyrics and more unique composition than this one, but damn is this song a work of art. The fact that it manages to sound as awesome as it does, have words as powerful as it has, and remain radio friendly enough as a means to introduce newcomers to the band is commendable. Damn great song.

I'm broken. Foo Fighters has been my favorite band since I was a teenager, the band that made me fall in love with rock. Losing Taylor is like I've lost a part of it, a part of my youth. I do not know how to explain. I've always loved all these guys and their songs have always kept me going, always been a part of my life. These guys changed my life, you are my heroes. We gonna miss you forever, Taylor...

The world is going to Miss Taylor greatly, I know I am. He was an amazing drummer,and the way he always smiled just had a way of cheering people up. It's also amazing the way music can touch people. Music is an amazing thing , considering how someone you have never met can touch you so deeply inside.

Breaking Benjamin is one of those rare bands that really keep to their sound, they know that their fans love their sound so that's why they haven't changed even to this day.
Been a fan of them since I first heard their song Blow Me Away on Halo ‚ù§Ô∏è

This song helped me through a terrible break-up. I used to think that the relationship was 8 years wasted, but now that I've matured I've realized it was just another chapter of my life, and I'm grateful for the memories.

15 years ago on this day, friends.     

Mind blowing how time continues to fly by.   Sadly, for me anyway, this album was the turning point when BB starting going south and slipping into over-produced radio rock territory.   Album has a few good songs such as this + the intro.  Topless was solid, but that was originally wrote sometime around their 1st album.    Which is a shame because Saturate and We Are Not Alone have both aged VERY well as alt-grunge offerings.  Just seems like most people only really appreciate Phobia and beyond when the gem of their work was the early times.

The Diary of Jane - Single Version,Breaking Benjamin,"15 years ago on this day, friends.     

Mind blowing how time continues to fly by.   Sadly, for me anyway, this album was the turning point when BB starting going south and slipping into over-produced radio rock territory.   Album has a few good songs such as this + the intro.  Topless was solid, but that was originally wrote sometime around their 1st album.    Which is a shame because Saturate and We Are Not Alone have both aged VERY well as alt-grunge offerings.  Just seems like most people only really appreciate Phobia and beyond when the gem of their work was the early times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWaB4PXCwFU

I'm almost 56  and when I first heard this song maybe 11 years ago I didn't get into it.  But it grew on me as I grew older  It's a great song about carrying on in the face of adversity.

I'll never forget when a coworker was telling me about how ""Death Bed"" by Powfu was so original, because it was a song that put death in a more beautiful perspective. I just listened until she was finished, and then played this masterpiece for her.

God, I remember when my dad had his thyroid cancer and everyday I would wake up wondering if today's the day he would leave this world. It was so fucking terrifying. I used to listen to this song to make me feel better. He's managed to make it, and I'm so fucking proud. He was fighting for so long, and it payed off. He was told he didn't have long, and yet here he is. I can't imagine what it would be like without him. It sounds fucking cringe, but I still look up to him like he's a superhero, even if he's not perfect.

There's a lot of heartfelt love for classic 70s-80s rock in this song. It exudes influences of Queen, Van Halen, The Police, GNR, maybe even a hint of Pink Floyd.
I'm 45 and a bit old for the emo years but MCR stands out for me as a band of that ilk that actually had impressive rock sensabilities.

The production is brilliant, you all look kickass, the song is timeless - in fact, I reckon it gets better with age. We all get old but, no matter what happens, this exists and you should be proud to point at it and yell, ""THAT'S ME!""

Love songs that change into something completely different halfway through. From Paul McCartney's ""Uncle Albert"" to, well, this classic banger!

This song hits hard. It's actually about drug addiction. My best friend and I were celebrating his birthday on April 18th, 2019 at the karaoke bar. He was singing this song that night; he died days later of a heroin overdose. After recently finding out this song is about drugs, now I understand why he chose it.

That's how I felt about my exes and they didn't treat me well. It's time for me to get my life together and play more music that relates to my life's situations. I need to stop worrying so much and ease the pain from misery and aggravation. Remember if you lose everything and still have God you have more than enough to start all over again. I will always love you to life. I love Three Days Grace and I will always play this song when I am down.

I had just graduated high school when this came out. My girlfriend left me for college, my car broke down, I had lost my job and had no money. I joined the Army after that for 6 years. This song brings me back to half my life ago when I was young dumb and in love. She broke my heart and just when I was starting to recover from it 2 years later I made the mistake of letting her back in my life and doing it to me again but this time she was leaving to study abroad in Italy after a summer fling. Now I‚Äôm married with a son on the way. That funny bitcoin stuff everyone was joking with me was dumb ain‚Äôt so dumb anymore and our government which I loved and fought for is the most corrupt of all. I‚Äôm ranting. This song brings me back‚Ä¶ so much has changed

This song is a culmination of emotions for me. Brings me back to a time I thought I was lost but I had it better than I ever would realize until recently. To anyone reading this, it can always be much worse. Always. Be grateful for what you do have, those people you STILL have. Regret has no place in the present ‚ù§Ô∏è

I remember listening this song four years ago when my first girlfriend left me and I thought I would never overcome her, now I went back to listen again this master piece with my girlfriend, the one I truly love, and I think those thoughts I had were a lose of time.

My Dad would always sing this song when I was younger. Years pass, and here I am now. This song will always bring back memories, its so nostalgic. I should have cherished what I had at those times. Whether if its something as simple as clothes, or the friends you have, you never know when something will go away until it does.

Been in bands all my life as a guitar player, bass, singer, and drums for a short period. All comes down to this....if you have a great drummer, you'll have a great band. This is a damn good drummer.

This song was a big part of my childhood and I never even realized. I miss being a little kid, going into my ""secret hideout"" in the woods, climbing trees, having barbecues with my family, getting pushed on our tire swing, I just miss being young and completely oblivious to everything that was happening in the real world. I miss my little world.

This music video came out when my dad was in the hospital, comatose, due to a stroke originating in his brain stem. He died within the week. I was enthralled with this song, and the video just made me more into it. I asked a friend‚Äôs mom to buy the cd for me at the store because it had the explicit sticker, and I was only 14 at the time. I went home and listened to the album over and over and over. I still listen to it this day, at 31. It has helped me for years to deal with death and loss and all the emotions that come with it. It is my comfort album. Thanks MCR for being the best therapy.

The thing I always loved about this song is the catharsis.

There's something that, at my lowest point, I found comfort in for just being able to blast this song and admit, I'm not o-fuckin-kay. With defiance rather than self-pity, no apology to yourself or anyone else. Helped me recognize that I'm fucked up in my own right and maybe it's permanent and maybe it's not, but it's mine and I own it.

This band died before I knew about them and now that I love them I feel a weird naslagia feeling when read through the comments and watch their videos. They didn't make music they made a generation. They have cried with me, sang with me, saved me from falling to far apart when I needed something to hold me together, we can't let them fade in the history of the 2000s, even though they aren't coming back and we're broken and defeated we must make their memory carry on. Because I know they've all at some point helped you through that hard time. The lyrics are actually deed and meaningful and it's helped me so much. I think it's time this comment rests in the cemetery that this comment section is for the future baby emos to see, So long and Good night.

This song reminds me that youth doesn't have the only monopoly on having ""issues"". You just get better at handling/getting through it. It only feels impossible sometimes, and the words are easy, but it takes a very long time being not o.k and being o.k with it. Keep your head/spirit/soul where you need it.

My goodness this band is phenomenal. It bothers me when people just refer to them as ‚Äúthat emo band,‚Äù because they‚Äôre so much more. They‚Äôre up there with the best bands of all time, their creativity is unmatched, and they continue to inspire.

MCR is one of the best bands ever, because they are really relatable for kid's who are or were in Middle/High school and probably even younger. They're amazing and I hope the next generation will keep them up (I'm sure they will) thank you MCR <3

This song hurts every fiber in my being, yet I still listen to it because it's the last thing I have left. This song was playing on the radio when I was driving in my car to see my grandpa. I got the news that he passed while this song was playing. I had to pull over on the freeway because I was crying so hard. I miss him more than words can say. He was unlike any other person and my world will never be the same again.

My boyfriend who passed away a few weeks ago sang this song  when we were at a bar doing karaoke one night. Since he sang it that night, I had been trying to figure out the name of it; I finally came across it tonight. The song has so much meaning to me. We were together for five years and were both young when he sung this song. Now I just watch the video of him in my phone when he sang this song that night at the bar,  wishing he was still alive, wishing that we could go back in time to when we were young. R.I.P. Chris, I'll always love you.

Soy Mexicano y la chica del video se parece a mi hermana. Por eso el video significa mucho para mi porque, AMO esta canci√≥n y me enorgullece que The Killers haya decidido hacer el video en mi pa√≠s, pero tambi√©n odiar√≠a ver a mi hermana enga√±ada y llorar y sufrir de esa manera. Los Mexicanos nos volvemos muy locos cuando alguien lastima a las personas que amamos. No s√© si a mi hermana la han lastimado de esa manera porque nunca nos ha dicho algo as√≠ y tampoco la he visto triste. Pero si alguien la lleg√≥ a lastimar as√≠... que bueno que nunca me lo dijo, por que de ser as√≠ hoy yo estar√≠a en la c√°rcel.

Maybe my favorite The Killers song ever. I think this period in their evolution was really special. Their brand of heartland rock so well defined and poetic touching cue in most of our brains that we latch our own personal, often heartbreaking, stories to. Absolutely love this song and video.

This song is amazing on its own, but I feel that once you watch the video you can't hear it the same way. It's quite gripping and very relatable to us, adults, who have, in fact felt the exact heartache this woman felt. Quite a story inside a song!

Nostalgia is both an amazing and sad feeling. Still remember those days, looking out of the car window at night as my parents played this song. I miss being younger, I was so much more happy, confident, could actually talk to people without being awkward, I was rarely anxious and didn't care about politics. Listening to this feels like I'm back in those days.

This is one of my very favorites songs of The Killers, they just posted a bit of the song in their Instagram today, I had to listen to the whole music tho... I mean, it's not a song, it's so much more, everybody can relate to this, and every once in a little while we listen to it and reinterpret it in a whole new perspective. I just love it!

This song and video make me think about all the suffering we experience in our lives. I sit here wishing life could be easier for us, and remember that so many people in history have gone through worse pain than most of us can imagine. How lucky we are to be alive and feel sorry for ourselves.

We were together for five years and were both young when he sung this song. Now I just watch the video of him in my phone when he sang this song that night at the bar,  wishing he was still alive, wishing that we could go back in time to when we were young. R.I.P.

My mother who passed away 11 years ago  (I'm now 19) Loved  Foo Fighters. She struggled with drugs and alcohol. But she was a beautiful woman. I couldn't have wish for a better mother. This was her favourite Foo Fighters song. Brings back memories. The good ones. Rest in peace Taylor Hawkings, my mother would've been devastated.

Grew up with the Foos and always loved Taylor Hawkins as a drummer, singer, overall musician and as a person. Can't imagine what the Foos, their fans and family are going through right now. He added so much to the band. His groove, his energy, his backing vocals, his chemistry with Dave. Always gave 100% every show. Rest in peace Taylor Hawkins. You touched the hearts of and inspired so many people. Sad to see him go way too soon

I‚Äôm a 13 year old drummer, and no doubt wouldn‚Äôt be without Taylor. His energy, enthusiasm and pure talent will be viewed by me and so many others as one of the most heartbreaking losses in rock history. Sending best wishes to his family and friends, and hope they recover with time. RIP Taylorüò¢

Started learning this song on drums the other day. Taylor has been such a huge and recent inspiration to me. His realness and talent was so inspiring. His passion and love for music was infectious, I could watch countless interviews from him, and I have. I have no words about how I feel right now. I will give this song my best performance, for you Taylor. Rest in piece.

I listened to this song in my teenage and college years and just liked the sound. I'm 33 now, and my brother is an addict. I never realized until tonight when this song came to mind and I pulled it up to listen that it's about addiction. Reading the comments and listening to the song after so many years has me dripping tears. Thank you Staind and everyone who's commented about how this song has helped them.

Every time I hear this song I feel it deep in my heart. I'm a recovering addict and I've survived but some have not. I wish I could say I'm sorry to all that I've hurt through the years.

I hide this song in my soul knowing the feelings that will appear once it plays, but on rare occasion will let this masterpiece flow and bring them all back, doesn't help I heard my drunk parents listen to it nonstop on repeat while they destroyed my childhood. I still have so much love for this song as an adult.

I started my road to recovery recently. I know not many people will read this, but every day truly is a battle. Regardless of what substance becomes your high of choice, your darkest battles are fought in your soul. The worst truth of all is that you will never be truly free, only momentarily without chains on your hands. The happiest I ever was was when I was at my worst, and that will always be a testament to my shame for what I eventually became. I only valued me and in the end I nearly killed myself, and ultimately I wasn't who was being hurt the most. The people around me were.

One of my favorite things about this song are the comments from everyone on the personal demons they overcame. Keep fighting the good fight. Anything worthwhile doesn't come easy. God bless you.

I heard you and this song 20 years ago and I remember the feeling of hopelessness and determination you gave me with these lyrics. The desperation is still here but more as an afterthought of everything that has happened to me in the last 2 decades. I still keep coming back for your lyrics as a way of reminding myself who I was, who I turned into and who I still wish to be. God bless you Aaaron. You will never know how much inadvertently you influenced my thoughts.

This song was ahead of its time. It's so powerful and it talks about a really tough subject that no one wants to hear. I will always have a special place in my heart for this song. The things people go through are horrendous and it makes me happy to know that people actually care enough to voice their opinions and stand with those that can't stand for themselves.

I was born in the 70's, my teen years were 1980-1988. I thought the rock and metal i grew up with faded away, but Red Jumpsuit Aparatus, Yellowcard, etc renewed my faith. I listen to these guys more now than ""my"" music. I hope you don't mind an old metalhead hanging around!

I worked for a radio station when these guys were promoting ""Face Down"". They were on my show the day the lead singer of Boston died (Brad Delp). I was pleasantly surprised when the lead singer felt my pain that day. We talked about how ""More Than A Feeling"" was one of the best songs ever recorded. They were all really nice guys and I liked this song too. Yay Florida!

I heard this song when I was 10 years old, and it brings tears to my eyes every time. My household never had domestic violence, so when I spent the night at my friends house and heard his step-dad beating his mom, I never felt so afraid in my life. What‚Äôs crazy is my friend wouldn‚Äôt even seem bothered by it üòï I played this song a lot and dreamed about standing up against his step dad one day. This song has changed so many lives ‚ù§Ô∏è forever in my heart

I was a sophomore when I first heard this song. And I had a sociology class project & I picked this song for some reason. We got to play a song & make a poster. Later on in life I experienced the  meaning of this song. And so did my mom & grandma. At the time in high school with the project, I thought about them though. It's a subject that should be talked about more, even though it's difficult.

This song literally gave me the courage to confront my neighbor about his domestic abuse! I was threatened with eviction and harrasssed, but I didn't stop calling the police and reaching out to help the girl he was abusing! And in the end, she actually left him and thanked me for caring. It's the greatest thing to learn that you actually made a difference and helped someone! Never give up! And to all the scum bags in the world, WE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE WONT BE SILENT ABOUT IT!!!

This is my daughter and I's song. The day she was born, I felt more happy than I have ever felt. She's my Island in the Sun, and I'll never feel bad anymore. She's my best friend. I hope she'll always see me as such, and maybe one day while listening to this, will see this message and remember how happy she makes me.

I first heard this song on the radio when it came out back in 2001. I was driving along the beachside in Cottlesloe, Perth Australia. I was with my two friends and we were just jamming and gliding to this song and we ended up driving an extra 100 miles because it was so fitting driving and seeing the Oceanview and soaking in the summer heat in my Mercedes Convertible. Good times... One of the best moments of my life, thanks to this song. It's forever in my car song collection.

Just literally like a month or so I started listening to this song. I knew it existed but I never really thought much of it. That was up until I started hanging out with this very cool and chill guy who I really like; put this song on in his car. Now whenever I heard this song, it reminds me of him and it also brings me happy memories. But I only hear it whenever I hang out with this dude and I'm not kidding y'all, he gives me the butterflies (the happy, warm kinds). Just 3 days ago, I finally had the courage to tell him how I felt for him cuz he makes me feel safe, gives me great advice, I can trust him with anything, and he encourages me to push my limits. Not to mention he's a nerd for finance! (I'm slowly learning little by little about it). No guy has ever made me feel like this, it was always more lust than an actual, genuine relationship. The funny thing is, is that he said he kinda knew it all along but didn't think it would be that soon. I really hope he likes me the way I like him cuz he's just simply amazing.

Island In The Sun,Weezer,"Just literally like a month or so I started listening to this song. I knew it existed but I never really thought much of it. That was up until I started hanging out with this very cool and chill guy who I really like; put this song on in his car. Now whenever I heard this song, it reminds me of him and it also brings me happy memories. But I only hear it whenever I hang out with this dude and I'm not kidding y'all, he gives me the butterflies (the happy, warm kinds). Just 3 days ago, I finally had the courage to tell him how I felt for him cuz he makes me feel safe, gives me great advice, I can trust him with anything, and he encourages me to push my limits. Not to mention he's a nerd for finance! (I'm slowly learning little by little about it). No guy has ever made me feel like this, it was always more lust than an actual, genuine relationship. The funny thing is, is that he said he kinda knew it all along but didn't think it would be that soon. I really hope he likes me the way I like him cuz he's just simply amazing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erG5rgNYSdk

Saw these guys in 2003 on a rainy memorial day weekend festival. The pit was a giant mud puddle. Mud was flying through the air, topless chicks were wrestling in it all while these guys were jamming on stage. No one left that concert clean physically or spiritually.

I remember this song from when I was a little kid I stole this CD from the mall I lived by when I was a child and I played it in my basement and this was one of my favorite songs randomly under the age of 12 I think I was between the ages of 8 and 12.  Because my mom would give me the money lol. Cool memories

I love singing this song while alone in the car. I like how the beginning of the song is slow and depressing kinda representing the depressive state at the beginning of the rejection. Then later in the song it turns up to angry and even fun lol. It's been 2 years for me but she still fuckin hates me!!

Me and this song has history together. During 2019-2020 I spent a year and a half in jail (Rikers Island) awaiting trail for a crime I didn't do. 
During my wait in that hell hole of a prison. I was treated with such disrespect, talked to and locked in the cage as if I was an animal and attacked by the guards/pro-team officers. However everytime I heard this song play on the radio it  gave me motivation, gave me courage and gave me faith that I would be out of that place one day and due to COVID-19 and then the Floyd riots I was released and is blessed/thankful that I have finally found this song that kept me going.

estando de novios ella me la dedico, sin saber que para mi era una de las canciones mas hermosas de coldplay, cada segundo que recorre la cancion me recuerda a cada momento que vivimos juntos, a cada beso, a cada abrazo, a cada sonrisa, a cada mimo, a cada caricia que simplemente florecia en mi hacia ella, al dia de hoy tomamos caminos separados, pero tuve el placer de devolverle el hermoso gesto que me dio, despedirme de ella dedicandole la misma cancion con la que empezo todo, no se como estaras ni si me extra√±as, pero siempre vas a ser el amor de mi vida ‚ù£Ô∏è

Yellow sempre ser√° a minha m√∫sica favorita desse mundo, a m√∫sica que eu sempre irei amar com todas as minhas for√ßas. Ela representa tanta coisa pra mim... Dediquei ela a menina que eu mais amei nesse mundo, e por meio dessa m√∫sica, ela sempre ser√° lembrada. Eu sei que talvez ela nem lembre quem eu sou, mas meu amor por voc√™ sempre ser√° sentido atrav√©s dessa m√∫sica.

‚ÄúFor you I‚Äôd bleed myself dry‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think those people realise what they mean to me. They picked me back up when I was losing hope. I became happier and more motivated. The light at the end of the tunnel became brighter. They mean everything to me, no matter if they don‚Äôt feel the same. They made me believe again. I love them so much and I have so much to thank them for.

Un sentimiento tan hermoso transmite est√° canci√≥n, soledad y compa√±√≠a, sentir amor por personas que realmente amas mucho, personas que amaste con todo tu ser y ahora ya no est√°n! Te da Paz y una vibra tan linda, el amor es tan lindo pero para muchas personas es algo est√∫pido y que piensan que no vale la pena, pero em realidad lo es todo cuando de verdad se saben querer y entender, cuando hacen un equipo juntos y se proponen metas! Amor que desear√≠a que todos se den y jam√°s sufran por alguien que no los supo valorar, mereces que te amen tanto para que te dediquen esta bella canci√≥n ‚ú®

Funny how nostalgic songs can be. I remember first hearing this song when I was driving one summer night with my friend. He was softly signing along with it and I was like ""what song is this?"" and he told me. This was probably in 2006-07. He since moved to Texas, I haven't seen him in probably 5-6 years but this song will always remind me of that night. If you happen to read this James, I miss ya buddy.

Oh man this takes me back to when I was 10-11 years old... I remember hearing it and thinking it was the coolest thing ever but now that I'm 30 years old I realize how ahead of its time it was. The band might not be that famous but this cover was a total success and considering the original song was by Michael Jackson, you either screw up and be hated on for it or you actually make the cover good and making it good was what this band did so in my humble opinion, that's something to behold.

When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt know this was a cover. I remember seeing this and thinking ‚Äúwhat the hell is this??‚Äù Fast forward a few years, I‚Äôm a huge MJ fan. I watch this again and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúahhh‚Ä¶ now I get it‚Äù  It makes me so happy seeing tributes like this to MJ. Just proves how big MJ‚Äôs legacy is. These guys put everything MJ in here, the Wolf Mask, Bad Jacket, Anti-Gravity Lean, Kid dancing with face mask, Light up blocks, Black or White Car explosion (with MJ flag in the background), sequin glove, everything you can imagine. And you‚Äôd have to be an even bigger fan to understand why the guy at the end had an Elizabeth Taylor tattoo. She was one of MJ‚Äôs best friends.

Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,We need to make dad bands a thing again.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,This song captures the very early 2000's very well. This is actually how it felt.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"Alien Ant Farm is the most underrated band. They're great, don't sleep on any of their albums.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"One of the BEST covers i ever heard on any genre, both musically and vocally, simply a perfect true cover and not only the same song played by others. And the video is brilliant and funny.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"Oh man this takes me back to when I was 10-11 years old... I remember hearing it and thinking it was the coolest thing ever but now that I'm 30 years old I realize how ahead of its time it was. The band might not be that famous but this cover was a total success and considering the original song was by Michael Jackson, you either screw up and be hated on for it or you actually make the cover good and making it good was what this band did so in my humble opinion, that's something to behold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"Great tribute to the now late MJ. This cover is really passionate, you can tell the guys in the band loved his music.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,This song was always blasting back in the day.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"As much as I love this, and this music video too. I feel bad for the guys, their fear did come true. Pigeonholed
as a one-hit wonder, people who just saw this have been missing out. Rest of the album is just this good",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,The bassist singing the high harmony..' I dont know' gets me every time. what a cover!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"AAF, The only band I've seen live to carry the whole set as recorded live, the absolute closest to the album version I've ever seen. I will never forget seeing them perform BDO Gold Coast. Absolute animals on stage, perfect live band in every way. Absolute professionals in every way!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,Its crazy how many people come back to this everyday... this song is a masterpiece!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE

Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,"When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt know this was a cover. I remember seeing this and thinking ‚Äúwhat the hell is this??‚Äù Fast forward a few years, I‚Äôm a huge MJ fan. I watch this again and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúahhh‚Ä¶ now I get it‚Äù  It makes me so happy seeing tributes like this to MJ. Just proves how big MJ‚Äôs legacy is. These guys put everything MJ in here, the Wolf Mask, Bad Jacket, Anti-Gravity Lean, Kid dancing with face mask, Light up blocks, Black or White Car explosion (with MJ flag in the background), sequin glove, everything you can imagine. And you‚Äôd have to be an even bigger fan to understand why the guy at the end had an Elizabeth Taylor tattoo. She was one of MJ‚Äôs best friends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE
Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,I was 12 when the original dropped and 25 when this was released. I now have 2 layers of nostalgia ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE

Smooth Criminal,Alien Ant Farm,This song reminds of me 2001-02 such a great cover and this band is so underrated but AAF got bunched into that one hit wonder syndrome that plagued music in the late 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs. The whole album was very good and it‚Äôs sad to say they didn‚Äôt stay in the spotlight longer because this is a very good band,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE

 When they change keys, and launch into the pre-chorus, ""Annie are you okay?"",

One of the great things about Green Day (beyond their music of course), is that unlike other punk rock bands at the time, they didn't take themself so seriously that they always had to be edgy. And this song and music video perfectly shows the serious and fun sides of Green Day.

This was before YouTube, and major social media like Facebook. a time when you had to wait for this to come on the radio, buy it on cd or get it on limewire. A time when you hung out outside and played this on a boombox or portable cd player. God I miss the 90s and early 2000s (2000 - 2003)

When I listened to them back in 2005 2006, I was 15 years old and didn't understand a word of English. But was jamming to their music and trying to dress like them, which is why people were tryna bully and laugh at me for being different growing up in Russia. But the crazy thing is now I fluently speak English and what they say in their songs is literally how I always felt : ""go to college or university, get a real job thats what they said to me but I can never live the way they want..."" dropped out of university cuz I didn't like it at all and only was doing it cuz my parents told me so. Never had a real job for more than one-two months. Still managed to do what I like, whatever it is, make money and enjoy life. F a 9 to 5, I don't want that boring life!!!

To all the 12 -17 yr olds listening to FOB as a new thing someday you'll be in your twenties and hear these songs and feel a tinge of pain in your heart and want to cry and that's the emo in all of us Emos that connects us all. Also you're not alone we all feel that way about music that has memories.

Oh the good old days when you had your ""jams"" that you always listened to in study hall and on the way to and from school... I remember my biggest ones throughout the years were Dance Dance, Thnks fr th Mmrs, Numb, My Immortal, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Jesus of Suburbia. How I wish I could go back to those simpler times...

If my memory isn't failing me, the reason this vid was made was to insult their previous record company. The band parted ways with the label after some disputes in the creativity department, so the guys decided to portray them as chimps. They also took the vowels out of the song title cuz the company told them to shorten their song titles, so they did that just to add insult to injury. Idk if the whole Pete sleeping with the director's wife thing is real, but it was definitely thrown in to piss off the company even more.

This song came out well into my 20s, and I had never been a fan of the band prior to that... But it came at a pivotal time in my life and was the perfect therapy for what I was going through. Over time I explored their music and now, well, they're one of my favorite bands ever, and so much of their music relates to so much of my life... Their music always helps center me in rough times.

Thnks fr th Mmrs,Fall Out Boy,"If my memory isn't failing me, the reason this vid was made was to insult their previous record company. The band parted ways with the label after some disputes in the creativity department, so the guys decided to portray them as chimps. They also took the vowels out of the song title cuz the company told them to shorten their song titles, so they did that just to add insult to injury. Idk if the whole Pete sleeping with the director's wife thing is real, but it was definitely thrown in to piss off the company even more. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzL0EM1pKY

I dedicate this song to my parents, a special woman who rightfully walked out of my life last week, and everyone else I‚Äôve wronged in the past. I was self centered, lazy, insecure, a liar, and a bitter jerk. I was not the best son, friend or boyfriend. I will do everything I can to turn my life and attitude around.

Ou√ßo essa m√∫sica e volto no tempo que era crian√ßa. Ouvi pela primeira vez quando estava indo pra praia pela primeira vez tamb√©m. Sa√≠mos de Goi√°s at√© S√£o Paulo numa D20 branca, de madrugada, em comboio com familiares. Lembro que estava chorando por meu pai estar em um carro e eu em outro e essa m√∫sica come√ßou a tocar. √â estranho, hoje em dia essa m√∫sica toca e todos os familiares que estavam nessa viagem morreram ou se afastaram. Sinto falta daquele tempo e como sei que n√£o volta mais, ou√ßo essa m√∫sica para lembrar daquele momento, mesmo que eu estivesse chorando, ainda sim estava com os meus que hoje em dia, se foram. Essa m√∫sica tem um significado importante para mim e n√£o pela letra, mas pelo momento. Saudade v√≥, tios, primos e todos que estavam comigo naquele momento, essa m√∫sica √© para voc√™s!

It's strange missing someone you've never met. Taylor and the Foos have been a part of millions of lives for a long time. I'm sad for Dave and the band, the families, the friends and all of the fans. We've all lost a long time friend that most of us just happened to never meet in person. RIP TAYLOR!!! Time for you to rock out the cosmos!

I love the Foo Fighters, but more than that I love their humility. They never see themselves as bigger than anyone else, they involve the fans in their concerts, they share the love of music with the fans, and they are just down to earth guys. For a guy of my age who grew up in the 50's and 60's, it's refreshing. In the 1970's I played for the All Blacks, (you may need to research that), but staying humble when you are world famous is not easy for some. Fame can easily control you. But if you share your delight with your fans, you can't help but remain grounded.

They never see themselves as bigger than anyone else, they involve the fans in their concerts, they share the love of music with the fans, and they are just down to earth guys. For a guy of my age who grew up in the 50's and 60's, it's refreshing. In the 1970's I played for the All Blacks, (you may need to research that), but staying humble when you are world famous is not easy for some. Fame can easily control you.
