I've only now realized how interesting this music video is with the songs context. Knowing she was assaulted and that this song is about feeling unsafe at night, afraid of being attacked (presumably by a man) this music video feel like confronting masculinity (as almost all of the strangers shown are men of different ages and all the shows/activities are generally considered masculine). It feels like a video of trying to almost shock therapy yourself by surrounding yourself with what scares you (like men in general after one attacks you) and learning to be comfortable in that space, both interacting with them and just as someone who happens to be existing in that same space.

I take the song and video as Grimes reclaiming her experience. She turns her paranoia from previous experiences with men into empowerment. Rather than seeing masculinity as something to be afraid of, she attends all these ‚Äúmanly‚Äù events and champions it. She overcomes a traumatizing event by putting herself within an environment that portrays masculinity in a more silly, rather than fearsome way. It‚Äôs inspiring.

""The song is about being violently assaulted and it made me crazy for a few years. I got really paranoid walking around at night and started feeling really unsafe. The song is more about empowering myself physically amongst a masculine power, and the hate of feeling powerless, making light of masculine physical power, making it jovial and non-threatening. I took a typically violent cultural situation and made it pop and happy.""

Damn her earlier work is still so precious, so special, so avant garde, I can't really compare it to anything. With her first 3 albums I always have a sense of peace, like I am living in an enchanted forest in a small wooden cottage far away from the real world.

I literally started hearing her today and oh boy I'm hooked! I definitely think she's one of the most underatted international artist. I mean this song alone for me is grammy worthy, the surrealism she brings into her work is amazing. I'm so looking forward for her 35 track album now! Wow I mean wow! This might sound weird but she reminds of a Japanese novelist haruki murakami .... As his works are also surreal and I love both of them! Power to her!! And I feel so bad I heard her today only. Anyways at least I didü§≠

Because of this music video I traveled from Germany to Montreal, Canada in Nov 2019 to visit this place. I listened to this song while walking through the Expo 67 island...yes, it was pure magic.

I think I recognize this footage, if anyone's curious it‚Äôs from an event called ‚ÄúExpo 67‚Äù hosted on an island in Montreal that happened for one year in 1967 hence the title, where a bunch of nations participated in showcasing different parts of their culture. Many of the buildings and structures were very futuristic looking, designed to show off the peak of architecture and technology, including the monorail transportation you see in the video, and a few films even used it for a sci-fi setting. I think the setting works perfectly for the dream like quality of the music :)

all i can think about when i hear this song is how i drove down the highway with my left hand out the window, screaming into the wind because i had my first kiss the day before with a girl that i knew i would be in love with for the rest of my life. I heard this song on the radio and it had the same feeling of nostalgia yet joy that I still feel when i think about her, and how young we both were and how excited and happy we were to be with eachother. so thank you alvvays for an amazing song trapped in an amazing memory

Heard this song last night on the train in Japan. I was mesmerized by the singer's voice. Looked up the band (Alvvays) on YouTube and was mesmerized once again by singer Molly Rankin and this video. They spliced the band into footage from Expo '67 in Montreal like something out of Forrest Gump and it all just fits so beautifully.

Those first lines, ""I hate you for what you did, and I miss you like a little kid"" made me burst into tears the first time I heard them because it finally put into words my complex feelings toward my abuser.
Over 70% of assaults against women are committed by a known person. So while one might think it makes sense for a women to hate their abuser and have no positive feelings attached to them, that's rarely the case. A lot of women feel guilt over that because you should hate the person who hurt you, right? But what if that person was your support system, made happy memories with you, etc? It's incredibly confusing and upsetting..

I could be totally wrong, but I think the suit represents her taking back power (from an abuser or toxic partner) and the scooter shows that she's still really young (early 20s) despite all that's happened to her. Amazing song. Amazing lyrics!!!

""there are no words in the english language, i could scream to drown you out."" this line reminds me of my mom, it's like there's nothing i could say to her that would get through to her. there's nothing i could possibly say to make her stop being the way she is. it's a heartbreaking line honestly.

I dated this guy for 3 years. He was the love of my life. There is absolutely no way I can describe how much he meant (and unfortunatly still means) to me. Since the first time I layed my eyes on him, I knew that was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I did not believe on love at first sight, but he changed that in a second.

Not sure if anyone else noticed this, but the part where Phoebe rides a scooter down the street is a huge nod to Elliott Smith's Miss Misery video, where Smith walks down the street being followed by a cop. Phoebe is even riding down the same section of street used in the Miss Misery video (N Hoover St where it intersects w/ Lucile Ave and Clinton St). Compare the videos and you will see that it's the same stretch of street, albeit 20 years apart. She is also wearing a suit and sunglasses, just like Elliott. Nice little Easter egg/tribute.

The first lines hit hard ‚ÄúI hate you for what you did, but i miss you like a little kid‚Äù it sort of describes my relationship with my dad, he usually took his angry out on me as a kid and pushed me away, and i will admit it did hurt but after the years went by, i think i started to get over it and realized i needed to move on, so that‚Äôs what i did. I do miss him at times like i did when i was a little girl, but i realized that i shouldn‚Äôt and i should move on from him, that i should hate him, but it‚Äôs hard; even as time passes by, i still can‚Äôt get rid of this hurt feeling that i have because of my dad.

this song is so bittersweet bc it perfectly describes my relationship with my mom. i wish our relationship could be how it was when i was little, but now all she does is play the victim and reject her anger onto me, and nothing i do is ever good enough. maybe she was always like this but i didn‚Äôt see this bc i was a kid?

So many feelings in this song. Yes, she‚Äôs condemning him, but she‚Äôs also openly admitting to maybe somewhat missing him, thanking him for what little support he did give ‚Äúyou gave me $1500/I was hoping you would let it slide, you did‚Äô. She also looks back at his anger ‚Äúthrowing rocks around your room‚Äô and hoping the scars don‚Äôt make her possibly relapse ‚Äútrying to stay clean and live without‚Äô. All in all, it‚Äôs an incredibly mature set of lyrics for such a young artist. I walked away from this song feeling many things‚Ä¶most of it her heartbreak and relief he is gone.

Honestly this discribes my feelings towards my mom who committed suicide April 2nd 2021. My oma and I found her and this song puts into words so of the feelings I have, I'm mad and her for leaving me and my 7 siblings the youngest being 11, I'm mad at her for leaving it up to chance who found her and I'm mad that she didn't say goodbye. Sometimes it feels as though she didn't love us enough to stay and that though really hurts. My mom was an addict since she was pregnant with me and was suicidal since I was 2 she wasn't in my life until I was 7 and would cry about how much of my childhood she missed and now I'm 17 and she's going to miss the rest of mine and my siblings lives.

The first few lines, ""I hate you for what you did, and i miss you like a little kid,"" always make me break down because it describes my feelings towards my cousin. He m0lested me when I was younger it never set in during the moment that what he was doing was wrong because when people would talk about being sexually abused or assaulted it was so much worse so I had always played it down even though it always ate away at me. He did it twice, both times being near and around family, and I never told them after it had happened, I told my mom months later. I was only like seven and i missed him and when we would play but i never felt comfortable or safe around him and I still don't. I'm 15 now and all i want is to hear him apologize and say he's sorry, even if it doesn't change my feelings or attitude towards him, i just want to hear him admit what he did. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

Motion Sickness,Phoebe Bridgers,"Those first lines, ""I hate you for what you did, and I miss you like a little kid"" made me burst into tears the first time I heard them because it finally put into words my complex feelings toward my abuser.
Over 70% of assaults against women are committed by a known person. So while one might think it makes sense for a women to hate their abuser and have no positive feelings attached to them, that's rarely the case. A lot of women feel guilt over that because you should hate the person who hurt you, right? But what if that person was your support system, made happy memories with you, etc? It's incredibly confusing and upsetting.. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sfYpolGCu8

I feel like this song is saying if you want something to happen, just go for it and dont be scared. Tell that person you like them, start a conversation with someone you find cute, ask someone out for a drink, because if you overthink it and wait too much that opportunity might be gone and you will miss out on so much that could've happened. Like the title says, dont delete them kisses at the end of the message or spend ages writing out something to just delete it, send that risky text! Because in the end whats there to lose, you'll probably find the other person feels the same :)

My ex used to play with song all the time when we first met. Later on in our relationship she told me she listened to this one hundreds of times, thinking about me.  We had a great relationship, we ended about 6 months ago but this song just got recommended to me. It‚Äôs amazing how music can take you back to a time and place. Wherever my ex is now, I hope she is happy and knows that I will always be a friend x

i watched this music video and fell in love with this song a couple of years ago but never showed it to anyone because it felt like my little secret. last week, i was on the LIRR coming back from a concert at about 2 in the morning, and the train carts were filled with twenty-something-year-olds coming back from their nights out. filled with couples holding each other and falling alseep on each other and just talking and laughing even though everyone was a little bit exhausted. it really reminded me of this video, so i came back here to watch it. i hope i fall in love like this one day and that no matter what happens, i can get somebody to hold and ride the train with.

College Storytime: Long story short, a guy I made friends with the first day of our archaeology class studied together throughout the semester. I quickly developed a crush on him but didn‚Äôt know if he felt it back. We even went on pseudo-dates where we studied over lunch at a cafe and got dinner and ice cream after class, but we didn‚Äôt call them dates and it never got romantic. He‚Äôs graduating in a few days, and I thought it was too late. He almost had an Irish goodbye, but last night after we went out with friends and we‚Äôd each gotten home, I was a bit drunk, and texted him asking how he felt about me. He told me to meet him outside my building in 5 min to figure things out. When he pulled in, he got out of his car, walked directly to me, and said ‚Äújust kiss me.‚Äù üòç

I keep coming back to this video and each time, without doubt, it reconfirms itself as the best music video I've ever seen.   The production is faultless (and difficult to achieve on London transport), the cinematography is superb and the acting so believable - the couple do appear to be genuinely in love (perhaps they were. I'd like to think so).  It's both uplifting and yet sad.   What might be.  What is.  What was.  It reaches out to those lucky enough to know this feeling, and to those unlucky not to.  All in four and a half minutes of visual brilliance.

Me and this guy were so in love but he had to leave China for America. We felt like we were too young to be limiting each other with such a relationship since we were both broke and had a career to build so we decided to break up. On the last day we were on the subway to the airport in Shanghai, it was so sad so we put on music and this song came along starting with ‚Äúwhat if it‚Äôs not meant for me, love‚Äù and ending with ‚Äúme and you were meant to be in love‚Äù. He was sobbing like a child in my arm and everyone on the train was just staring at us while I kept telling him we‚Äôll be okay. It‚Äôs quite cheesy talking about it. I always loved this song but now it is forever engraved in my memory with that moment.

The initial excitement, the slow turn into arguing, the rebound of having fun and toned down affection from before and the happy ending, holding each other in their arms. 

I've been there, and that's how relationships are. You'll have downs occasionally, but the ups, attention and affection make up for it. This song is beautiful.

Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,This video is really beautiful . It does justice to so many kind of emotions between two people . The word love  is very overrated to me but this describes the beauty of companionship and togetherness so beautifully. Brilliant work!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30

Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,y‚Äôall don‚Äôt understand THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,"How did this song only reach 100 in the UK charts? It's a masterpiece! I can't stop listening to it. One the best songs I've heard in the the last few year and the best ""new"" song I've heard for ages.
I'd never heard of Wolf Alice till 12 o'clock this afternoon. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,"Lyrics: 

[Intro]
I see the signs of a lifetime, you 'til I die",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,"Me and this guy were so in love but he had to leave China for America. We felt like we were too young to be limiting each other with such a relationship since we were both broke and had a career to build so we decided to break up. On the last day we were on the subway to the airport in Shanghai, it was so sad so we put on music and this song came along starting with ‚Äúwhat if it‚Äôs not meant for me, love‚Äù and ending with ‚Äúme and you were meant to be in love‚Äù. He was sobbing like a child in my arm and everyone on the train was just staring at us while I kept telling him we‚Äôll be okay. It‚Äôs quite cheesy talking about it. I always loved this song but now it is forever engraved in my memory with that moment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,Her voice is amazing she sounds like what I imagine an angel would sound like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,The vocal harmonies throughout this song really do so much for the heart and soul üíö,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,I was not expecting my emotional state to be attacked so violently by this video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,"My dad found this band during his first trip in hospital last year this is all he had to keep him entertained, he died in hospital this year 18th of August , he was a new Wolf Alice fan but loved them, I‚Äôm trying to find all the songs he listened to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30
Dont Delete The Kisses,Wolf Alice,"The initial excitement, the slow turn into arguing, the rebound of having fun and toned down affection from before and the happy ending, holding each other in their arms. 

I've been there, and that's how relationships are. You'll have downs occasionally, but the ups, attention and affection make up for it. This song is beautiful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxE-zppu30

This is my favorite genre of music video - when a band is early in their career and shoots a behind the scenes video of them while everything is all still fun and magical. No big budget, no concept, no narrative, no problems. Theres something so wistful and nostalgic about this type of video, and this video/song in particular.

A happy little sad song with an 80s feel - never heard it before but I really like it a lot! Definitely needs to be played loudly in the car on a dark road late at night -windows down - and the feel of the  night air blowing thru your hair! I love it!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

When a relationships ends, but that one is hopeful for its resurrection... you pray and hope for not necessarily a change in other person, but that you yourself change for the better. The lyrics beautifully, desperately, and hauntingly capture that angst of waiting for your loved one to turn back.

Although I've lived in SoCal for 8 years, I was born and raised in ""flyover country"" like the folks in this video and this video wholly encapsulates everything that we're about. It's absolutely magical; I can smell the scents of Fall in this video. I can feel my family and the community in it. They're the best people in the world from the best place in the world. I'm so happy Future Islands chose it for their video of an amazing song.

These guys sing better than Lord Huron live, I came to that conclusion after they started for them at Leeds 2018. A comment shouted to Lord Huron was ""it sounds like you are singing under the ocean, you ball sack"" Flyte were the better of the two groups.

Her voice and expression resonate deeply within in me. It touches a despair I feel and that I think many people do. She wears it so freely, without putting a mask on to hide her pain. Thank you! Not everything is sunshine and roses. Pain does exist, and there's nothing wrong with it.

I love Courtney, she's such a genuinely lovely person. I saw her over 4 years ago in a tiny local venue and made her a little gift as I was watching her. I shyly gave it to her afterwards, whilst people were getting CD's signed. She asked me what I was doing later that evening and if I wanted to come to her performance at a much bigger venue, also locally. I'd already had plans that night, so I didn't get to go, but I was so touched by her kindness and humility. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Heard this song on KDVS 90.3 while driving and it was just one of those perfectly timed moments I like to call ""movie soundtrack"" moments. The driving speed, the volume level, the time and color of the day, the blur of what's been past on the drive, the head space, the smells, the thoughts and emotions, the vibe the universe was on that very second.. with just me..  and just like that- an ordinary moment with ordinary being. This ..is how memories are made

This one girl was absolutely crazy over me. I was at the time too, i was on a trip in hawaii staring at the sunset and she sent me this song, one of the happiest moments in my life was hearing this song knowing she had nothing but love in her mind when she sent it. The sunset and all these feelings im processing while hearing this amazing song, I‚Äôll never forget it.

This makes me hopeful for an afterlife where all of the people in this crazy world with crippling stress, anxiety, and difficult situations can finally rest and be at peace. My father died a couple of months ago. He came to me in a dream. He looked younger, maybe in his twenties or thirties. He told me ""I'm okay son."" and we just hugged. At some point I realized it was a dream and I hoped the dream would last forever. I'll see him again someday.

This made me think of my cousin who died in 2015. I can't help feeling like he might have experienced this sense of peace afterwards, given how much he suffered from depression up until the end. Whatever the other side looks like, I hope he's still at peace.

I first heard this song when I deep in depression, in a stage when I was already thinking of suicide. Nowadays I associate this song to that suicidal period. But not in a dark way: This song works as if it transports me through time and allows my cured self to visit my sick self. It is a strange but really good feeling of victory and self knowledge.

I was really into this song at the end of 2019 and I was listening to it watching this video when I heard my brother screaming outside my room for my grandpa. January 17th, haunted me for so long. First time ever seeing a dead body let alone my grandfather I'd lived with most of my life. How someone goes from having feelings, memories, opinions, interests, to being a lifeless shell. That's something I had never came into contact with before. This song represents that for me, that whole dreadful experience. It makes me sad to hear it. I don't think I'll ever not associate the two. So I've forget both. I would say I choose to forget the experience and the pain but really I did it without a choice. I never wanted to forget him. I loved him. But it was the only way I knew how to cope. I listened to this song on repeat the whole way to and from the funeral. And after that Thursday, I never listened to it again. Not until now, over two years later. And honestly I don't actually associate the two things anymore, the song just brings me grief but not like it did. Just a reminder that loss is unavoidable. I try not to think about what it will be like when my parents die, or god the love of my life. Loss. That's my word for this song. Had to get this out of my system. Never told anyone. Rest in Peace Pap.

Let It Happen,Tame Impala,"This made me think of my cousin who died in 2015.

Let It Happen,Tame Impala,"I first heard this song when I deep in depression, in a stage when I was already thinking of suicide. Nowadays I associate this song to that suicidal period.

I am now living in Kevin Parker‚Äôs Dimension.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFptt7Cargc
Let It Happen,Tame Impala,"I was really into this song at the end of 2019 and I was listening to it watching this video when I heard my brother screaming outside my room for my grandpa. January 17th, haunted me for so long. First time ever seeing a dead body let alone my grandfather I'd lived with most of my life. How someone goes from having feelings, memories, opinions, interests, to being a lifeless shell. That's something I had never came into contact with before. This song represents that for me, that whole dreadful experience. It makes me sad to hear it. I don't think I'll ever not associate the two. So I've forget both. I would say I choose to forget the experience and the pain but really I did it without a choice. I never wanted to forget him. I loved him. But it was the only way I knew how to cope. I listened to this song on repeat the whole way to and from the funeral. And after that Thursday, I never listened to it again. Not until now, over two years later. And honestly I don't actually associate the two things anymore, the song just brings me grief but not like it did. Just a reminder that loss is unavoidable. I try not to think about what it will be like when my parents die, or god the love of my life. Loss. That's my word for this song. Had to get this out of my system. Never told anyone. Rest in Peace Pap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFptt7Cargc

Let It Happen,Tame Impala,"This song is what I feel every time I feel out of control or filled with anxiety or a panicked sadness spiralling deep in my own rabbit hole but it‚Äôs also beautiful in that it also puts me into that feeling to a point where I can just let go. 
There‚Äôs something about the pace and speed of the song that makes me feel like I‚Äôm flipping over my head over and over",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFptt7Cargc
Let It Happen,Tame Impala,The reflection of life and the analogy rendered by this piece is iconic.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFptt7Cargc

My boyfriend had a rough upbringing. Everyone in his family - parents, siblings, him - had a lot of tension and unspoken resentment towards another. When his niece was born 8 years ago, it forced everyone to come together, start forgiving each other and work through their feelings about the past. For that reason, my boyfriend has always been very close to his niece, because he feels like her birth was an important turning point for the whole family. I'll never forget the first time I played this song for him. We were in northern Michigan, driving on a winter afternoon with the sun setting behind us. I told him that this song reminded me of his niece, but I didn't say why. When it got the line where Sufjan sings ""my brother had a daughter, the beauty that she brings, illumination..."" he started crying. It was such a special moment.

To all the new people here, this song talks about Sufjan regretting not letting himself grieve his mother properly. He uses various metaphors to depict his depression. However there is hope in the new generation, which is symbolized by his brother's daughter and the way the music turns happier at the end. ""Illumination""!

I loved his music since the movie ""Call me by your name"". This is the kind of music i feel connected with all my heart. It is extraordinarily beautiful and i love the fact that it evokes and makes me feel my deepest feeling or the fact that it is able to make me feel!! I believe every soul listening to this kind of music feels the same. One night you just want to close your eyes and feel this song and some nights you want to feel what others felt through this music and know about their experiences, hear the hearts of people miles and miles away from you. Listening to the music while scrolling through the compliments towards every wonderful music and realizing how connected we are to share our melancholy and blissfulness makes me extremely delightful.

Grandmother passed away in March
My mother couldn‚Äôt attend the funeral because of her health problems. She didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye to grandma. It was devastating for all of us.
I was sitting by mom and calling her name, but it felt like she didn‚Äôt even hear me. So i decided to put on some music for both of us. After the first two minutes of the song she burst into tears. And so did I.

The lyrics are a true masterpiece. But am I the only one who loves Sufjan Stevens because you can put your own mind, your own feelings directly on his musics ? I'm French, so it happens sometimes (often) that I just don't understand the lyrics. But then it becomes even better. It becomes incredible. Because this is not Sufjan who is talking, this is actually me, listening to the song and putting my own thoughts in it. I don't know, never felt that way with any other music than Sufjan's. And I love it. And this album is going to be damn good.

What can I say about Sufjan Stevens and his delightful songs that hasn't been said before? Pure and raw emotion. This one song in particular takes me back to the summer of 2018. I didn't even know who Sufjan was at that time. I was staying with my grandparents and younger cousin in a small villa in a beautiful village in Spain. Everyday my cousin and I would go swimming to a nearby river in the middle of nature where the sunlight was always shining on the water. We would spend hours there just chilling, sharing our thoughts or playing cards. After lunchtime we'd go visit a boy and he'd give us cherries he cultivated. I ended up falling in love with him. When the sun started to go down, my cousin and I would go for a walk around the village and would get lost in its narrow streets. But we didn't care, because we were having so much fun and in the end we always found the way back home. I know the lyrics of this song have nothing to do with my summer holidays. But there's just something about it that takes me back to that happy time, when I didn't have a care in the world. And to this day, I still remember everything about it. I even remember how I felt the first time I saw that boy. All of that is still kept in my heart as a warm memory, and I doubt I will ever forget about it. I never write this kind of comments, but Sufjan's song inspired me in a way I can't explain. It's truly a masterpiece. Hope everyone is safe and having a good day.

Carrie and Lowell is one of those albums that's rare today, a true album that is more than the sum of its parts.  Sufjan has created a cohesive work with a consistent theme, more than just a collection of beautiful songs but rather all variations of his theme of loss and grief.  The songs are meant to be listened to one after another, not separately.  This is a true work of art and I only wish I owned it on vinyl.

Should Have Known Better,Sufjan Stevens,"What can I say about Sufjan Stevens and his delightful songs that hasn't been said before? Pure and raw emotion. This one song in particular takes me back to the summer of 2018. I didn't even know who Sufjan was at that time. I was staying with my grandparents and younger cousin in a small villa in a beautiful village in Spain. Everyday my cousin and I would go swimming to a nearby river in the middle of nature where the sunlight was always shining on the water. We would spend hours there just chilling, sharing our thoughts or playing cards. After lunchtime we'd go visit a boy and he'd give us cherries he cultivated. I ended up falling in love with him. When the sun started to go down, my cousin and I would go for a walk around the village and would get lost in its narrow streets. But we didn't care, because we were having so much fun and in the end we always found the way back home. I know the lyrics of this song have nothing to do with my summer holidays. But there's just something about it that takes me back to that happy time, when I didn't have a care in the world. And to this day, I still remember everything about it. I even remember how I felt the first time I saw that boy. All of that is still kept in my heart as a warm memory, and I doubt I will ever forget about it. I never write this kind of comments, but Sufjan's song inspired me in a way I can't explain. It's truly a masterpiece. Hope everyone is safe and having a good day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJJT00wqlOo

Should Have Known Better,Sufjan Stevens,"Carrie and Lowell is one of those albums that's rare today, a true album that is more than the sum of its parts.  Sufjan has created a cohesive work with a consistent theme, more than just a collection of beautiful songs but rather all variations of his theme of loss and grief.  The songs are meant to be listened to one after another, not separately.  This is a true work of art and I only wish I owned it on vinyl.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJJT00wqlOo

I'm a gravedigger, and with covid-19, work has been grueling for many months. The last 8 days have been the busiest and darkest days I've had since I was deployed in the late 90's. I got home from work today and got served papers. Started having an anxiety attack, then I put this on repeat. Life isn't quite as hopeless anymore.

Amazing track from Spoon, I remember having loved it right after I heard it on the radio. Thanks to radio Nova, in France, for always spreading really talented people and bands.
Years after, it's always a pleasure to listen to this track. Their album also is really good.
I'm like flying, dreaming, floating in space...and maybe more simple things, enjoying this track, thanks to them.

Is it wrong that I'm crying when I listen to this and that I'm a fully grown middle aged man who shouldn't be this excited by new music from the band?

OMG.... loved it all... wanted to cry with you guys. Deep emotions with the fact that you dared to get together again to make music. The images in the video... the pics of the other members in each other's wall... Thanks for stopping the hiatus! Love and respect. Hope I can see you performing someday. Greetings from a Venezuelan guy in Argentina.

The only problem I have with this band is that when I tell people I love BBC they either think I'm talking about the British Broadcast channel or the other sexual thing lol, I miss these indie days when there were so many great bands with this happy indie sound! If you are looking for similar new song with this sound you should check out Lonely Gimmick - Grumpy Days, it's seriously one of the best new songs I've heard in a while and is a super upbeat indie track

Great song! Brings me back to the alt-sound of the 90's. A lot heavier and more mature than their previous work.

Listening to this song, I'm lying down my bed thinking about how bad I miss and love my dad. He's not perfect but he's perfect at being the only and best dad I've ever known and had. 
PS Thank God, he's still alive!

I really feel like rock/folk music is in a really low key phase right now. It's probably a good thing for rock to go underground for a while, so that great bands like this can experiment with different styles of music. I feel like when guitar music does become big again it's going to take a lot of people by surprise.

I appreciate how this was directed, with increasing warmer color tones, in the opening moments as Danielle discards her parka. Once outside, the tones are mostly on the cooler side, with pale blues and greens. The cooler tone gives way to a warmer light, and by 1:15 we're awash in reds and golds. Nice work!

This song is so beautiful that it makes me tear up.  As a guy that used to play bari sax back in the day and loves the Lou Reed/Jazz feel, I heard it on the radio and got hooked.  After I found out what the inspiration for the song was, I get wrenched so hard by it as a cancer survivor.  Such a beautiful song and such wonderful people writing it and singing it.  They may continue to do more amazing things (and already have) but this is a song that's going to stick with me for as long as I'm still around.  Thank you HAIM, thank you so very much.

What!? What kinda fate is this?

Not really relevant to the song / video, but right before the pandemic, I was flying into Beijing to be with my SO for Christmas. It had been a long flight, and I had my Spotify on shuffle. This song came on while we were on final approach, and it gave me great vibes. Whenever I hear it I think of that crisp, sunny winter morning and the amazing time I had with my SO in Beijing. It's quite bittersweet for me, as it's almost been a year since we've last seen each other because of the virus. I really miss you, Z.

This is a truly outstanding band and I am just finding out about them... I am 62 and I just haven't heard anything new that spoke to me with exception of Rival Sons and Greta Van Fleet in the last several years..... but this is a thinking band with cryptic lyrics... and that really sends me... I have listened to about 5 songs and like every one of them... I heard ""Pain"" playing as I went into the grocery store and shazamed it....   It is quite an unusual song to be used in a public playlist but I am glad it was playing....

Greatest non-mainstream (although still kinda technically mainstream) band in probably at least the last 20 years.

So fine to be alive for many reasons. Music is one of the most stimulating reasons for sure. Finding this was as sweet as finding anything else from my youth. It's weirdly like something I've heard before but probably better. The 70s influences marinate this band.

The voice cracks aren‚Äôt tolerable in other types of music but that‚Äôs the good about indie music, no autotune, no over productivity of the track, just a raw feeling and that warm feeling. I love that he doesn‚Äôt use autotune which is why I think a lot of people love his music and I love it too.

For those who did not understand the music, FIFA's decision to award 2014 without thinking about the poverty that destroyed Brazil is critical, that decision spent 24 million reais (Brazilian currency) and that money was taken from public coffers, it ended up destroying the economy a lot.And well, on the part ""I heard you sold the Amazon"" he criticizes the deforestation that was very high at that time, unfortunately even today the Amazon is sold illegally but fortunately not with the same frequency as before.

Declan if you see this, stay true, stay real and don‚Äôt get lost. People will start to try and control you, let them think they are in control and use their contacts to get where you wanna be. But always stay true and write for yourself, if you like it so will we. If you try to make people like or write for them, the essence of what makes u great will get lost. I think you are literally what many of us have been waiting for my friend! Peace out from Neil in Leeds

Gente vamos aplaudir o cara pela critica, mas sem rebaixar nossos artistas. Ainda existem artista que criticam a situa√ß√£o em que o Brasil se encontra, o problema √© que nem sempre a maioria dos brasileiros est√£o dispostos a ouvir a cr√≠tica e e refletir, eles preferem escutar m√∫sicas que falam de: bunda e trai√ß√£o, fazendo com que assim aja mais m√∫sicas desse tipo (por fazer tanto sucesso).

I now cry when I hear this song. I fell in love with it when I discoverd it in 2016, Declan had no media coverage in France and I thought ""This boy is a genius ! He'll go very far if you give him the corerct sourroundings."" Go Declan go, you can do it, and thank you for your work until now.

I met Declan 2 nights in a row. I called him memelord Declan. He signed my shirt as memelord Declan.

He is completely awkward, super sweet. The hugs were so funny because I am just as awkward. We went for them like 3 x before we hugged it out.

I played this song at a party 2 weeks ago. A friend of mine came in and was like ""Did you just play Bakar?"" and we bonded over how awesome this artist is. He then recommended the rest of the EP (Will you be my yellow). Unfortunately, the same friend passed away last weekend very suddenly. Forever, this song will have a tinge of sadness for me but this song will be a beautiful reminder of how great a person he was. Rest in peace Kieran, much love, you've truly went to a better place.

Yes it's one of those songs - you like it the instant you hear it.

It's so simple how they portrayed that post-breakup feel in this video. That sobering 'what do I do with myself now.' Feeling lost in a supermarket-- learning to just shop for yourself again. Wandering around your house, expecting to see your lover. I think my favorite part is the champagne. She pours it out for someone else, as she must have many times before, but realizes she must drink it herself. Break-ups force us to be alone and focus (almost) entirely on ourselves again. Whether it was intentional or not, I see the champagne as symbolic of her doing something for someone else /out of habit/ and then realizing she deserves that taste/ceremony of celebration too.

I remember feeling lost after my boyfriend of 5 years and I broke up. I wandered around expecting him to show up at random moments, staring out into space for what felt like hours at a time, sitting alone in my living room feeling like if I left the couch I would fall into a hole in the floor, or maybe I was just hoping that I would. It took me a couple of years to finally feel like I was over him, but every once in a while, when I hear a song we liked or see something that he would wear in a store, I will feel that pang of my heart cracking just a little bit at the corners, like an old plate that's been dropped and glued back together too many times. It's funny, but I always knew that we wouldn't stay together and I even told him so. About 2 years in I told him that I was just a stepping stone for him to get to the other side of his creek of life, a means for him to find his way back to where he wanted to be. He laughed it off at the time, but when we broke up after he got out of alcohol rehab and moved to Chicago he told me I was right and had been all along. This song reminds me of when I told him he would eventually leave me, and I was just waiting to lose him.

I think this music video is showing how some people focus so much on the idea of losing their partner, that they forget that they are still with them and enjoy the moment. Thats why at the end, when the sign says, turn around, it is to remind her that her partner is still right there.

Kate Mara plays this role so well. This is a perfect 4 minute deep dive into her character in ""Pose"" after she finds out her husband has been cheating on her. The depth in the emotion that's seen and felt here are everything and would perfectly compliment that character if juxtaPOSED.

I love this music video. The way it captures the feeling of staring into space, lost in thought, and yet dizzying feeling of being alone with worry. How the actress has all these small nervous tendencies like grabbing a single orange, swishing the cafe drink, swaying her feet. It's all ways to keep yourself preoccupied so people won't know you don't actually know what you're doing, just feeling lost. Yet, you have to keep going in life.

This song has POWER.
I was on a run at 4:30am, just because.  Ran through a playlist until I heard...THIS.
Listened to it over and over, felt emotion welling up. Couldn't explain it for the life of me then but now... it was hurt. Confusion. Divorce. That ill you feel when you're still in love but you know it's over. But, don't know why. And worse, you don't know your next step.

The editing and camera direction in this is superb, it was confusing at first bc I couldn't tell whose perspective this was supposed to be from because she kept looking in front, to the side/behind herself. It felt looking the camera was someone that was actually occupying the space she was in with her. But when it finally clicked that she was just waiting expectedly for someone that was long gone it made me have such a punch in the gut reaction, and now when I look back at her dazed and longing expression I just get experience that same emotion all over again. Just amazing song all around.

It‚Äôs been a year since I first heard this song and although, I can easily listen to it, I love watching the music video more to hear it. Kate Mara does an excellent job with capturing the existential dread one feels when they know their relationship is slipping and waiting for the other shoe to drop; the phone call, a text or the conversation that will lead to the eventual break up. I also love how I can see that her performance can be interpreted as life in the post break up. Feeling lost and adjusting to a life without that person that was once such a central part of their life.

When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"Directed by Van Alpert Produced by Douglas Kerr 

Listen/Buy Violet Street: https://found.ee/LN_VioletStreet",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"It's so simple how they portrayed that post-breakup feel in this video. That sobering 'what do I do with myself now.' Feeling lost in a supermarket-- learning to just shop for yourself again. Wandering around your house, expecting to see your lover. I think my favorite part is the champagne. She pours it out for someone else, as she must have many times before, but realizes she must drink it herself. Break-ups force us to be alone and focus (almost) entirely on ourselves again. Whether it was intentional or not, I see the champagne as symbolic of her doing something for someone else /out of habit/ and then realizing she deserves that taste/ceremony of celebration too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,LIS is helping me improve my playlist. Thanks again.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"""And the light that was still slipping through was painting your body in stripes"" That is so perfect. Whoever wrote that line is genius",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"""I remember trees coming down like an archangel choir""....powerful and riveting verse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"I remember feeling lost after my boyfriend of 5 years and I broke up. I wandered around expecting him to show up at random moments, staring out into space for what felt like hours at a time, sitting alone in my living room feeling like if I left the couch I would fall into a hole in the floor, or maybe I was just hoping that I would. It took me a couple of years to finally feel like I was over him, but every once in a while, when I hear a song we liked or see something that he would wear in a store, I will feel that pang of my heart cracking just a little bit at the corners, like an old plate that's been dropped and glued back together too many times. It's funny, but I always knew that we wouldn't stay together and I even told him so. About 2 years in I told him that I was just a stepping stone for him to get to the other side of his creek of life, a means for him to find his way back to where he wanted to be. He laughed it off at the time, but when we broke up after he got out of alcohol rehab and moved to Chicago he told me I was right and had been all along. This song reminds me of when I told him he would eventually leave me, and I was just waiting to lose him.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,Local Native's music is too damn underappreciated. Life is Strange introduced me to them and I have been hooked up since. These guys need more exposure!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM

When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"I think this music video is showing how some people focus so much on the idea of losing their partner, that they forget that they are still with them and enjoy the moment. Thats why at the end, when the sign says, turn around, it is to remind her that her partner is still right there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM

This is a perfect 4 minute deep dive into her character in ""Pose"" after she finds out her husband has been cheating on her. The depth in the emotion that's seen and felt here are everything and would perfectly compliment that character if juxtaPOSED.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM

When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"I love this music video. The way it captures the feeling of staring into space, lost in thought, and yet dizzying feeling of being alone with worry. How the actress has all these small nervous tendencies like grabbing a single orange, swishing the cafe drink, swaying her feet. It's all ways to keep yourself preoccupied so people won't know you don't actually know what you're doing, just feeling lost. Yet, you have to keep going in life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,I got chills. Local Natives never disappoint.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"The falsetto in the chorus, mixed with the vaguely 80s feel of the instrumentation, reminds me so much of La Roux. Such a great song!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"This song has POWER.
I was on a run at 4:30am, just because.  Ran through a playlist until I heard...THIS.
Listened to it over and over, felt emotion welling up. Couldn't explain it for the life of me then but now... it was hurt. Confusion. Divorce. That ill you feel when you're still in love but you know it's over. But, don't know why. And worse, you don't know your next step.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"Wait, when am I gonna lose you?
How will I let you slip through?
Careless or unkind?

When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"One of the most beautiful, as in aesthetically pleasing, songs I've ever personally had the good fortune of hearing...How utterly...charming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,I sometimes look at my fianc√© while he‚Äôs sleeping or something and the horrible thought of us just maybe falling out love one day enters my mind and this song just fits that feeling too well.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"I feel this, ladies and gentlemen  never waste your time on a man/woman that doesn't care about you its okay to be hurt and depressed for a little bit but if someone wants to walk out of your life let them just know youre all beautiful ‚ô•",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,Heard this on Alt Nation and turned the volume up! I immediately fell in love with this songüëèüèº,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"This goes out to all the people with crippling relationship anxiety! You're still worthwhile, even if you feel you're not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"The editing and camera direction in this is superb, it was confusing at first bc I couldn't tell whose perspective this was supposed to be from because she kept looking in front, to the side/behind herself. It felt looking the camera was someone that was actually occupying the space she was in with her. But when it finally clicked that she was just waiting expectedly for someone that was long gone it made me have such a punch in the gut reaction, and now when I look back at her dazed and longing expression I just get experience that same emotion all over again. Just amazing song all around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"Perfect song, perfect lyric, perfect melody. Definitively my favorite song. I LOVE IT SO!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM

When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"It‚Äôs been a year since I first heard this song and although, I can easily listen to it, I love watching the music video more to hear it. Kate Mara does an excellent job with capturing the existential dread one feels when they know their relationship is slipping and waiting for the other shoe to drop; the phone call, a text or the conversation that will lead to the eventual break up. I also love how I can see that her performance can be interpreted as life in the post break up. Feeling lost and adjusting to a life without that person that was once such a central part of their life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM
When Am I Gonna Lose You,Local Natives,"Im happy for you guys, I jumped in joy hearing you play in walmart, Y'all deserved to ""make it"", you put on amazing shows, and I love how you give to charities of women of sexual abuse ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWwytT5JAdM

Yeah, I know that this song is about being in love with someone and scared to tell them, but personally I like to relate it to my experience with my very strict, emotionally and mentally abusive parents, because with them, I have to pretend that everything is fine when all I want to do is run away and live for myself. I feel stagnant and trapped. I didn't want to talk to them or just watch tv and pretend that everything is fine when I just get worse and worse around them. My life is wasting away, when I'm trapped here, and every moment of it counts. I wish I could leave.

When the horns are introduced in this song, it reminds me of Mexican genres like boleros, mariachi, banda, etc. Honestly fits great with English lyrics, not sure why English-speaking musicians don‚Äôt try this some more.

I wish he would have made this video into his first original idea, which was him renting a chapel and staging a dozen kittens in there and having two of the kittens being married. I'm so pissed I'll never see that.

This guy is in love.  He ain't faking it, that's for sure.
This song is so moving, and beautiful that I feel a strong urge to wake my girl up just to tell her that I love her.  Well done, Mr. Tillman, well done, indeed!

2 years ago I got divorced. I've been afraid of love after giving everything I had. Father John Misty gives expression to something alive in our sociuety, we see it every day. Entropy, decay. The realization that most everything is shit and a lie. But a stalwart belief in the unfathomable power of love. I can't stop listening to this album. Since December of 2016, when I let myself fall in love based on instinct for the last time.

I don't see how people can say that Father John Misty is going in the wrong direction. This music seems much more evocative, and the arrangement in this song in particular is very well produced and well layered. I personally enjoy the direction Tillman is going.

Absolutely one of the most beautiful and lush songs I have heard in a long time. Being a 90s kid, this song sounds nostalgic yet fresh. I love listening to this song with my eyes shut. Closest thing to time travelling, albeit only for a brief moment. This song takes me back to when I was in elementary school age-- no worries, no problems, world filled with wonder, excitement, happiness, joy and filled my bones with chills and skin with goosebumps.

I can't stop thinking about my best friend while listening to this amazing song, and I feel so lucky to have him in my life. I couldn't ask for someone kinder and funnier. He is the closest person to me, and also the furthest though. I'll never forget him, and I'll do everything I can to keep this friendship because it doesn't happen twice in life. I'll definitely show him this song.

This is definitely a true life account of Ellie Rowsell and a friend from childhood. It includes the lyric ""jump that 43"", Ellie grew up in the Holloway Road area of north London and the 43 bus goes through that area. Her and her friend jumping the bus - not forthcoming in paying the fare in other words - and going off to have an adventure somewhere.

Rewatching this, it resonates more when you realize they're willing to let go of all their material worth to complete the experiment. They go from a beautiful furnished home to a small, empty one where they drink champagne out of solo cups. They don't care. The only thing that matters to them is making this impossible dream a reality.

No, they did this whole professional grade mini movie for a music video. I‚Äôm blown away! The song, the actors, the story....it all fit so well. I want this to win an Oscar!

The distance between Sylvan Esso‚Äôs crisp electro-pop and Califone‚Äôs dark, shambling indie-folk is shorter and more direct than it might seem. And the cover you‚Äôre about to hear‚Äîgo ahead and click‚Äîof Califone‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuneral Singers‚Äù will quickly make clear that two disparate worlds have been deftly bridged, and that there is peace in the valley. This new version is faithful to the original in ways, gorgeously different in others.
 
The song is also bigger than Sylvan Esso‚Äôs core of Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn: It began as a spontaneous collaboration with the duo‚Äôs recent tour openers Collections of Colonies of Bees, a fun lark to play as an encore together. But their version of ‚ÄúFuneral Singers‚Äù immediately revealed something bigger and deeper, which makes sense: The relationship between the bands goes back a long way. Sanborn was briefly a member of Collections, whose evolving, revolving staff centers on Chris Rosenau‚Äîan old friend of Sanborn‚Äôs and a founding member of Justin Vernon‚Äôs Volcano Choir. Volcano Choir brought Sylvan Esso out on their first tour. And  Sanborn‚Äôs other band from his Milwaukee days, Decibully, opened for Califone‚Äîa band that inspired everybody in this equation. You could practically hear the click.

So it became imperative to capture ‚ÄúFuneral Singers‚Äù for posterity, and Wilco‚Äîanother definite but not-exactly-obvious influence on these bands‚Äîopened the doors of their home studio, The Loft, at the last minute so that this intimate little opus could be properly committed to tape. Califone‚Äôs original, from 2009‚Äôs All My Friends Are Funeral Singers, is spare even by that band‚Äôs standards: Singer and chief songwriter Tim Rutili plays a rickety acoustic and pulls his words from down deep in his chest, half-slurring his impressionistic tale of giving up but not giving in. A banjo and some half-heard background voices give it color, but it‚Äôs unmistakably dark.

Sylvan Esso and friends neatly removed the original‚Äôs shaggy five o‚Äôclock shadow with an electronic razor, adding a bass throb and nimble rhythmic tones‚Äîbut kept the warm sound of an acoustic strum at the fore. Also right up front: Meath‚Äôs gorgeous voice, which has proved time and again that it can start the party or bring it to its knees‚Äîwhatever she‚Äôs in the mood for. This version injects the original‚Äôs gorgeous, soul-bearing resignation with a little more hope: Tim Rutili‚Äôs suicidal lighthouse keeper will eventually make the leap, hers might fight off the demons for good.

It‚Äôs a neat trick that this spontaneous assemblage of musicians pulled off: They took a little song out of its dusty box, shined it up, made it huge, then somehow willed it back into the tiny emotional woodshed from which it sprang. ‚ÄúReturn, return, return to me,‚Äù it pleads. In Sylvan Esso‚Äôs hands, it‚Äôs found a new home.

Funeral Singers,Sylvan Esso,"http://www.sylvanesso.com

The distance between Sylvan Esso‚Äôs crisp electro-pop and Califone‚Äôs dark, shambling indie-folk is shorter and more direct than it might seem. And the cover you‚Äôre about to hear‚Äîgo ahead and click‚Äîof Califone‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuneral Singers‚Äù will quickly make clear that two disparate worlds have been deftly bridged, and that there is peace in the valley. This new version is faithful to the original in ways, gorgeously different in others.
 
The song is also bigger than Sylvan Esso‚Äôs core of Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn: It began as a spontaneous collaboration with the duo‚Äôs recent tour openers Collections of Colonies of Bees, a fun lark to play as an encore together. But their version of ‚ÄúFuneral Singers‚Äù immediately revealed something bigger and deeper, which makes sense: The relationship between the bands goes back a long way. Sanborn was briefly a member of Collections, whose evolving, revolving staff centers on Chris Rosenau‚Äîan old friend of Sanborn‚Äôs and a founding member of Justin Vernon‚Äôs Volcano Choir. Volcano Choir brought Sylvan Esso out on their first tour. And  Sanborn‚Äôs other band from his Milwaukee days, Decibully, opened for Califone‚Äîa band that inspired everybody in this equation. You could practically hear the click.

So it became imperative to capture ‚ÄúFuneral Singers‚Äù for posterity, and Wilco‚Äîanother definite but not-exactly-obvious influence on these bands‚Äîopened the doors of their home studio, The Loft, at the last minute so that this intimate little opus could be properly committed to tape. Califone‚Äôs original, from 2009‚Äôs All My Friends Are Funeral Singers, is spare even by that band‚Äôs standards: Singer and chief songwriter Tim Rutili plays a rickety acoustic and pulls his words from down deep in his chest, half-slurring his impressionistic tale of giving up but not giving in. A banjo and some half-heard background voices give it color, but it‚Äôs unmistakably dark.

Sylvan Esso and friends neatly removed the original‚Äôs shaggy five o‚Äôclock shadow with an electronic razor, adding a bass throb and nimble rhythmic tones‚Äîbut kept the warm sound of an acoustic strum at the fore. Also right up front: Meath‚Äôs gorgeous voice, which has proved time and again that it can start the party or bring it to its knees‚Äîwhatever she‚Äôs in the mood for. This version injects the original‚Äôs gorgeous, soul-bearing resignation with a little more hope: Tim Rutili‚Äôs suicidal lighthouse keeper will eventually make the leap, hers might fight off the demons for good.

It‚Äôs a neat trick that this spontaneous assemblage of musicians pulled off: They took a little song out of its dusty box, shined it up, made it huge, then somehow willed it back into the tiny emotional woodshed from which it sprang. ‚ÄúReturn, return, return to me,‚Äù it pleads. In Sylvan Esso‚Äôs hands, it‚Äôs found a new home.

The first time I ever listen this song was thanks to a friend during my longest and strongest (and also the last one) LSD trip that I ever had.
Since then, this song was always stick on my head as a reminder of that experience, and it has a lot of meaning to me.

When i was in universty, my friend showed me this song when we smoked. There was five of us, sometimes six, but every time we smoked, we would always spark up the last one and put this video on. I was supposed to graduate with these guys a few weeks ago, and over the course of university we became a small, weird, but very real family. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic I moved out six months ago and back to my home country. I miss my brothers. This song takes me back to them every time.

When I saw Tame live 2 years ago this was the encore song (of course) confetti canons were shooting off in the air, lasers were everywhere, I wasn‚Äôt even tripping but it felt like I was the whole show. I was walking back to my car after and reaching into my pockets and pulling out handfuls of confetti üòÇ it one of the best performances I‚Äôve seen, it will definitely be a vivid memory for the rest of my life.

Fantastic video, wonderful music, and really penetrating lyrics. I have to say, though, attention to detail is nice; the gun she uses to shoot her personal demon is an Arisaka Type 99...a Japanese rifle...because it's Japanese Breakfast. A nice touch.

She's a really big inspiration to me. I don't have a lot of creativity like I did, due to leaving things and people I loved behind. Not only her music but the things she has to say makes me feel happy. I'm the type of person that finds it impossible to say things, I keep my feelings to myself unless I make lyrics and say it though them. My friends don't get the message when I say things to them using music. What I'm trying to get to is Michelle and all her bandmates are epic! ‚ù§Ô∏è she helps me say things that I would usually find impossible! I love Michelle and the band to bits! Mwah üíã

Road Head,Japanese Breakfast,"She's a really big inspiration to me. I don't have a lot of creativity like I did, due to leaving things and people I loved behind. Not only her music but the things she has to say makes me feel happy. I'm the type of person that finds it impossible to say things, I keep my feelings to myself unless I make lyrics and say it though them. My friends don't get the message when I say things to them using music. What I'm trying to get to is Michelle and all her bandmates are epic! ‚ù§Ô∏è she helps me say things that I would usually find impossible! I love Michelle and the band to bits!

I used to smoke up alone quite a bit. And this was the first song I ever heard high, alone in a dark room. I can never explain the dimensions my mind went to listening to this. The colours I saw. The things I felt. Whenever I listen to this I go back to that feeling of being lifted to some other Universe.

To anyone listening to this song to find peace in a difficult moment, know that you are loved eternally. Not just from within yourself, but from outside as well. What ever is causing tumultuous-ness in your life, know it is temporary. Feel the love of your loved ones embracing you and know that their eternal selves are helping you with this moment. And know that it is absolutely ok to just breathe for a few minutes. Allow serenity and peacefulness and love to guide your rhythm back to a mastery of your present moment, and be the champion that you are. You are amazing, I love you üòä

The thing that I love about glass animals is that they are about to send you into a world where everything is wrong in a right way. Like heating water turns it into ice or that you can walk upside down in water, trees feel like fur and pillows feel like stone. It‚Äôs a twisted world but you want to know more about it and that‚Äôs the beauty of this band.

Nothing beats the feeling I got listening to this song and not knowing the name of the artist or anything, not hearing words only the sound of the voice singing as it blends with the instrumentation. Sadly over time the feeling has faded but this song really used to give me feelings of nostalgia, happiness and wonder. This song really taps on something I don't think I've ever felt from music before, it goes beyond the band or the album. This collection of sounds is truly something special.

The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write them down if I remember in the morning time 
I don‚Äôt know that much about Kingston 
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain 
I think that tonight I‚Äôll leave my light on
Cause I get lonely when it‚Äôs out and I miss you right about now 

Baby tell me where you want to go 
Baby tell me what you want to know 
Give you everything I have and more

He said baby, that‚Äôs what he called me, I love you 
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It‚Äôs the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takes me breath away, forget what I was gonna say 
The day that I met you I started dreaming 
Now I write them down if I remember in the morning time 

Baby tell me where you want to go 
Baby tell me what you want to know 
Give you everything I have and more

Sometimes in your life you cross paths with a song that will mean a lot to you - and this is one of them. I used to date this girl for a short while, she was my first love, she was the most beautiful girl in the world and it was amazing. Eventually we started making each other playlists and this song was the first song of the playlist she made for me. I remember sitting alone in my room, headphones on, hearing it for the first time and I started crying. The song reminded me so much of her, I couldn't stop listening to it. ""The day that I met you I started dreaming"" - it explained perfectly how I felt being in love for the first time. Unfortunately things ended between us, but this song will still remind me of her forever. It doesn't give me the same butterflies it used to give me, it has more of a bittersweet aftertaste now - but I'm still grateful for her and everything she has taught me about myself and love. So I still come back to this song from time to time, just to reminisce.

Faye Webster is so underrated. Her delivery is like nothing I‚Äôve ever heard before and every song she makes is different, but her style is still present through it all. She is so talented is many different ways as well, the visuals for all of her music videos are enticing and hypnotic. She is honestly amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to hear what she creates in the future.

Kingston,Faye Webster,"‚ÄúKingston"" by Faye Webster out now on Secretly Canadian

Stream now - https://fayewebster.ffm.to/kingston 

Directed by Faye Webster 
Shot and Edited by Hunter Airheart and Chlo√© Horseman

The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write them down if I remember in the morning time 
I don‚Äôt know that much about Kingston 
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain 
I think that tonight I‚Äôll leave my light on
Cause I get lonely when it‚Äôs out and I miss you right about now 

Baby tell me where you want to go 
Baby tell me what you want to know 
Give you everything I have and more

He said baby, that‚Äôs what he called me, I love you 
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It‚Äôs the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takes me breath away, forget what I was gonna say 
The day that I met you I started dreaming 
Now I write them down if I remember in the morning time 

Baby tell me where you want to go 
Baby tell me what you want to know 
Give you everything I have and more",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5_tGEao_GQ
Kingston,Faye Webster,"Sometimes in your life you cross paths with a song that will mean a lot to you - and this is one of them. I used to date this girl for a short while, she was my first love, she was the most beautiful girl in the world and it was amazing. Eventually we started making each other playlists and this song was the first song of the playlist she made for me. I remember sitting alone in my room, headphones on, hearing it for the first time and I started crying. The song reminded me so much of her, I couldn't stop listening to it. ""The day that I met you I started dreaming"" - it explained perfectly how I felt being in love for the first time. Unfortunately things ended between us, but this song will still remind me of her forever. It doesn't give me the same butterflies it used to give me, it has more of a bittersweet aftertaste now - but I'm still grateful for her and everything she has taught me about myself and love. So I still come back to this song from time to time, just to reminisce.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5_tGEao_GQ

Broken flowers, late night walks without exact destination and post-breakup melancholy.

If bytes could be consumed, I'd wear out the bits this digital album is made of after listening to it so many times already. A breath of fresh air in the depressing panorama of nowadays' pop music, although she probably would not particularly like to be called as such...
Great song, great album.

Love the entire album but this is my favorite track form it. The slow fade in intro reminds me of the intro to Sting's Be Still My Beating Heart. The album has many highlights and will be on my top five list for best of 2019.  Please come to Hampton Roads Virginia Nilufer.

Just found this song and group and I love them! Her voice sounds like a mix of Chrissie Hynde, Joan Jett and Michael Steele with a feel of Go's Go's as far as the band...just a bit. I'm sure no one agrees but I hear it. She has a very unique voice and I love it. Beautiful video, nice and simple, but makes me feel a sense of freedom. I would definitely like to be riding a bike alongside them.

This was super to publicise the daredevils here with this song. It would have also been awesome on a sunset load or sunrise load with some talented skydivers, too. You could have tandemed with them as well. :) Keep them coming guys. I am still a big fan of ""Heroine"".

I'm gonna break up with my girlfriend tomorrow, this music has helped me a lot to make this decision. Wish me luck! :)

Edit: well, I made this comment more than 1 year ago. I did breakup with her in the beginning of 2019. She didn't get mad, she was sad but we respected each other decision. Now days l'm still single and happy, I don't regret it, I know that I did the right choice at that time.

I‚Äôve loved this song for ages and there‚Äôs one line that always gets me...
‚ÄúI wish I could turn you back into a stranger‚Äù.
This hits me so hard because it makes me think of all the people I‚Äôve met, known and loved, and I wonder what it feels like if we just restarted everything, lost all those memories and started fresh.

I found this song some years back when going through my first really painful breakup ans i bawled my eyes out to it yet also felt like i was going on a spiritual journey listening to this song lol... i went through a couple more breakups and losses throughout the years and each time i found myself back at this song.. always evoking such feeling.. extreme sorrow and also deep connection to myself/optimism. Sometimes I'd just listen to it when reminiscing memories to make me cry when i needed to cry cause i knew it would. There's something compelling about this song.. metaphysical almost. What a truly beautiful experience to be alive at the same time as tame impala.

There‚Äôs so many feelings one could feel while listening to this song. It‚Äôs so easy to relate to yourself. Even if the lyrics aren‚Äôt in any way connected to you at all. Just something abt it. It‚Äôs like cracked out nostalgia. It makes you think. Impala really does something to you most music can‚Äôt. He has the perfect sound for every emotion. He‚Äôs nailed it right on the head.

I saw tame impala one night in my now exes city it was incredible. I wanted to experience this band for years and he is a huge fan being from Perth.

Around 3 years my now ex and I were together. We were in and out of each others home town. I ended up moving for him. We loved each other so much I couldnt even begin to describe it to you. We were best friends and we were unstoppable.

This song hits me hard. It sounds happy and it talks about being happy. But it makes me feel so sad, probably because of the word ""Eventually"". It changes the whole song. It turns the song from a ""i'm happy even though we had problems"" to a ""i hope i will actually be happy one day""

When 'Toto' was eight years old I was his drum tutor at Mullumbimby Primary. After showing him a basic rock beat he started playing and slipped right into the pocket, immediately making it groove. At thirteen his dad would bring him, Patrick and Louie to drum circles I was conducting and all three were really good rhythmically and after seeing their first band, it was really clear they had   chemistry, great energy and that something special. This is why music tutors do what they do. Congratulations lads, James.

Withorwithout,Parcels,"When 'Toto' was eight years old I was his drum tutor at Mullumbimby Primary. After showing him a basic rock beat he started playing and slipped right into the pocket, immediately making it groove. At thirteen his dad would bring him, Patrick and Louie to drum circles I was conducting and all three were really good rhythmically and after seeing their first band, it was really clear they had   chemistry, great energy and that something special. This is why music tutors do what they do. Congratulations lads, James.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUelBEuz258

Angel's melodic wail at about 2.15? Survivors tell me it's reminiscent of the irresistible song the Sirens use to lure sailors to their rocky doom. 

If Angel Olsen were ever to consider writing a rock opera, I hope she'd include this song. It's a perfectly incarnated synthesis of a Rocky Horror/Alice Cooper/Cheap Trick/Linda Ronstadt's 'Blue Bijou'/Marc Bolan's 'Ballrooms of Mars' type 70's genre piece; evocative, atmospheric and equal to anything produced during that peak historical period of melodic song writing.

Shut Up Kiss Me,Angel Olsen,"Angel's melodic wail at about 2.15? Survivors tell me it's reminiscent of the irresistible song the Sirens use to lure sailors to their rocky doom. 

If Angel Olsen were ever to consider writing a rock opera, I hope she'd include this song. It's a perfectly incarnated synthesis of a Rocky Horror/Alice Cooper/Cheap Trick/Linda Ronstadt's 'Blue Bijou'/Marc Bolan's 'Ballrooms of Mars' type 70's genre piece; evocative, atmospheric and equal to anything produced during that peak historical period of melodic song writing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nleRCBhLr3k

The way she can evoke complex emotion out of a small turn of phrase, or by a subtle alteration in a chord change, well, this is a rare gift. ""A photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam"" The way she carries the last syllable of Vietnam is haunting.

Another amazing song from an amazing artist.  You can just tell someone around her said that line; ""If you've got a spare half-million, you could knock it down and start rebuilding.""  Like so many other of her songs, that's what I think this song/story was formed around.  Not only that someone could so casually refer to a half-million like that, but also just so...callously disregard that the home is all that's left of someone's life; the little touches, the pressed metal ceilings, the handrail in the bathroom...all tiny signs of a life that's gone and someone is just thinking about money and equity.

a beautiful song that really hits a nerve - Barnett said in an article ""Feeling safe in the world relies on having somewhere to live,"" - i think this pretty much applies to whole world nowadays and the volatile things we are vulnerable to, whether natural, man made, or wholly the privations of human greed, ignorance and lust for power.

I've been waiting for the Album version of this for ages. Such a great song. Like always, Courtney manages to find the deeply emotion undercurrent in everyday activities, without having to be explicitly emotional. Such craft.

This song has helped me through tough times, and it is the first song I've heard from Courtney that has left me listening really closely and impressed. The way that Courtney makes the guitar chime gently and cry, the steady drum beat, and her unaffected descriptive singing all lend this song a peculiarly reassuring strength. This song normalises every feeling of weariness, disillusionment and disappointment in your life.

Depreston,Courtney Barnett,"This song has helped me through tough times, and it is the first song I've heard from Courtney that has left me listening really closely and impressed. The way that Courtney makes the guitar chime gently and cry, the steady drum beat, and her unaffected descriptive singing all lend this song a peculiarly reassuring strength.

I honestly don't see an issue here. He took the song, tweaked it to his liking, and re-released it. If anything, It's cool that we get to hear two different versions of the same song. Kinda neat getting a glimpse of what goes on in the mind of an artist. Both versions are bops

How is Kevin parker so good, he's like the iron man of music, a one man army, a psychedelic Jesus here as the second coming to save us with groove, if you ever get the chance to see him live take it, cant wait to see him live again, I need more music like it, I did just find a cool tune that kind of reminded me of tame impala, lonely gimmick - grumpy days, I like the guys other stuff as well, its like tame impala but more funky with some Hendrix guitar, worth a listen

A list of changes that occurred within both old and new versions of Borderline. 



- A different sounding snare was used, possibly remixed.

- The vocals sound clearer and I believe that some kind of a stereo-shaper was used.

First exposure to Lucy Dacus was ""I don't wanna be funny anymore"". That was a revelatory experience, and with each successive song I've just been more and more impressed. I love ""Night Shift"" in particular. Classic break-up song. Puts into words better than I ever could EXACTLY how I feel about my ex. This song, ""Cold Apartment"" by Vagabon and ""I'm a Mess"" by Bebe Rexha have been like my go-to songs when I think about him... I'm such a basketcase, getting choked up just listening to this song as I type this (lol... goddamn breaking up)

i love how this feels like such a story, like there's three mini songs in this one masterpiece that really take you through the feelings of a ruined relationship. it's like those poems written in sets that are all the same but just a different perspective of the subject, but more lyrical and set to rocking guitar lol

this is a bit personal but i honestly love this song.
this year marks 5 years since i started a 2 year toxic relationship that left me emotionally broken, my old partner made me think i didn't deserve to be loved, he isolated me and controlled me 'till we broke up and i cut any contact with him. 3 years after that breakup, These few days, i've been talking with this girl i just met last year, and she just told me she likes me back.

Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,you either listen to this song for 30 seconds or 30 times in a loop.. there is no in-between..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,This sounds like breaking up and being stuck living together until your lease is up. Everything might be sweet and cordial. But you need to get your time away from them.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,found this song in a mitski spotify radio and it blew my mind ... ive had the song on repeat everyday since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,"Fun fact I went weeks without crying, i was numb for that whole time. Then I lay down and listened to this song for the first time and jesus I‚Äôve never cried that hard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,"I love the moment when the guitar fuzz kick in. It takes the song from 90's coffeehouse music to 90's indie rock, a much needed shift.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,I have listened to this song at least 15 times in the last couple of days. I love how it builds to something. So many songs are so static.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4

Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,"First exposure to Lucy Dacus was ""I don't wanna be funny anymore"". That was a revelatory experience, and with each successive song I've just been more and more impressed. I love ""Night Shift"" in particular. Classic break-up song. Puts into words better than I ever could EXACTLY how I feel about my ex. This song, ""Cold Apartment"" by Vagabon and ""I'm a Mess"" by Bebe Rexha have been like my go-to songs when I think about him... I'm such a basketcase, getting choked up just listening to this song as I type this (lol... goddamn breaking up)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,The guitar at the end sounds like someone actually screaming. So beautiful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4
Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,"i love how this feels like such a story, like there's three mini songs in this one masterpiece that really take you through the feelings of a ruined relationship. it's like those poems written in sets that are all the same but just a different perspective of the subject, but more lyrical and set to rocking guitar lol",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4

Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,"I'll never forget first hearing this song on my drive back home after graduating college. I had just said goodbye to my friend-with-benefits, and I think I knew deep down I would never see him again. Or at least if I did it would never be the same. So many emotions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4

Night Shift,Lucy Dacus,"this is a bit personal but i honestly love this song.
this year marks 5 years since i started a 2 year toxic relationship that left me emotionally broken, my old partner made me think i didn't deserve to be loved, he isolated me and controlled me 'till we broke up and i cut any contact with him. 3 years after that breakup, These few days, i've been talking with this girl i just met last year, and she just told me she likes me back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDZdT04ls4

It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúseventeen,‚Äù it‚Äôs about potential, and forgiveness.  You‚Äôre the only person that can forgive yourself as you age.  It‚Äôs important to remember the love you embody from a young age, to not lose it.  You always embody beauty no one can touch, not age nor time.

I can't get over the powerful melancholy in this song. It's like a yearning for your youth, while appreciating how much more yourself you are with age. It's telling your younger self things will get better, while realising that they kind of didn't. It's reflecting on how much has changed with the passing of time, but the slap in the face that nothing has really changed at all...

Currently 19. Was 17 when covid started. The lyrics about being 17 and free really hit home for me‚Ä¶ like for everyone else, I feel like the pandemic has stolen some important years. I was kinda anxious that I‚Äôd missed out on a part of life I‚Äôd never get the chance to experience again. Felt like my development as a person was halted all of a sudden. But reading the comments under this video has given me a lot of hope for the future. Nice to know that that period can be bad anyway regardless of covid

As someone who has also lost a lot of their youth while fighting mental illness I really relate to everyone in the comments. The problem is our society romanticizes being young while ignoring the burdens and many changes you go through during that time. But realistically you're more likely to come across those aspects when you're older, like love, friendship and what makes you truly happy.

When I was 17, I was anxious and insecure. Now I'm 35 and I've never been better. There have been hard times, I've hit rock bottom in 2008/09. But I've moved on. Got helped by family and friends. Never surrender.

Gosh this song hurts so much. 
17 was tough. 
I was so damn lonely & misunderstood, yet didn‚Äôt have the emotional language to explain it, even to myself. I was in a big new city and too afraid to begin to navigate it. With parents who were so different, with different struggles and different backgrounds, different values and interests, that they had no idea how to help me in any way at all. School kids so different also, they had their own bubbles already, in a small private school. There was no room for someone like me.

i remember listening to edge of seventeen by stevie nicks and dancing queen by abba and even seventeen by kings of leon and peach pitt, respectively, at midnight when i turned seventeen alone in my bed. that was a really rough time for me, i was in my first relationship and it was so abusive and toxic. i‚Äôm turning 20 in a month and i‚Äôm in such a good place; life will always go up and down again. it feels so good to look back on who i was at seventeen. it feels like that girl doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, but parts of her are still in me. anyway, i‚Äôd just like to say that songs about being seventeen hold a special place in my heart, that was a defining time for me and probably most people

This song is my all time favorite. It resonates with the nostalgia for youth, destined mistakes and heartbreaks to make, knowing absolutely nothing but still being brave... 17 was a mess, a roller coaster ride, a reckless and stumble year that turns me to be the person I am. Looking back there were absolutely regrets, but I am smiling in tears and happy with what I‚Äôve become. Finally free

This song looks like lying on the bed alone, in a room with your mess and little tears in your eyes. blurry, red light fills the room and you don‚Äôt care that you turned seventeen yesterday and everyone remembered you.

Found this song from Sex Education, won‚Äôt be leaving for a while. As someone who‚Äôs turning 17 in just a couple months and who feels like he hasn‚Äôt really accomplished anything, this song makes me quite emotional, I actually kind of cried a little the third and fourth time I listened to it, and I‚Äôve listened many times since. It feels like I‚Äôm meant to be more than what I am. But that is what makes me appreciate the comments in this thread, these people talking about how they felt their teenage years were bad too, and others accomplishing their dreams in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs. Life isn‚Äôt over after 17, even if I, and probably others, feel like that a lot. But sometimes it‚Äôs hard to feel like you‚Äôre not wasting your time. And this song kind of makes it hurt, but in all the right ways. It‚Äôs a truly incredible song, I‚Äôm so happy to have found it.

I'm 16 and sometimes it feels so overwhelming to grow up, everyone changes when they grow up I learned that in the duration of my 16 years of life, you can never get those years back and it makes me sad deep inside because all we have now is to live in the moment and just be a kid in this world...

Interpret the lyrics how you will. The raw emotion packed in this song just gives you that feeling. Very few can deliver this. A timeless track, unlike so many others. Sharon Van Etten really did  an amazing job at 3:09 as well.

Honestly, I think the teeneger years are overrated. Your life won't end when you get in your 20's or 30's. You can be happy or sad at any age, and, honesty, I feel like I'm in a better place now that I'm turning 20 then when I was 17.

I often feel like time is running, and on every birthday, I think, ""Wait, I'm this old already? I never realised how quickly I was growing."" But this song makes so many moments, from as far back as I can remember, flash before my eyes, and I no longer wonder where did all that time go.

Seventeen,Sharon Van Etten,"It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúseventeen,‚Äù it‚Äôs about potential, and forgiveness.  You‚Äôre the only person that can forgive yourself as you age.

Seventeen,Sharon Van Etten,"I can't get over the powerful melancholy in this song. It's like a yearning for your youth, while appreciating how much more yourself you are with age. It's telling your younger self things will get better, while realising that they kind of didn't. It's reflecting on how much has changed with the passing of time, but the slap in the face that nothing has really changed at all...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA
Seventeen,Sharon Van Etten,"Currently 19. Was 17 when covid started. The lyrics about being 17 and free really hit home for me‚Ä¶ like for everyone else, I feel like the pandemic has stolen some important years. I was kinda anxious that I‚Äôd missed out on a part of life I‚Äôd never get the chance to experience again. Felt like my development as a person was halted all of a sudden. But reading the comments under this video has given me a lot of hope for the future. Nice to know that that period can be bad anyway regardless of covid ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA
Seventeen,Sharon Van Etten,"As someone who has also lost a lot of their youth while fighting mental illness I really relate to everyone in the comments. The problem is our society romanticizes being young while ignoring the burdens and many changes you go through during that time.

Seventeen,Sharon Van Etten,"Gosh this song hurts so much. 
17 was tough. 
I was so damn lonely & misunderstood, yet didn‚Äôt have the emotional language to explain it, even to myself. I was in a big new city and too afraid to begin to navigate it. With parents who were so different, with different struggles and different backgrounds, different values and interests, that they had no idea how to help me in any way at all. School kids so different also, they had their own bubbles already, in a small private school. There was no room for someone like me. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA

makes me sad people are only just hearing of this band now 10 years late. I remember the whole indie dress phase around 2010-2012 with all these bands. drinking and smoking in fields in the summer, fires in the winter and good friends listening to the likes of bombay bicycle club, two door cinema club, the kooks, arctic monkeys etc. and who can forget the guys wearing them cream chinos. what i'd do to relive it all again.

10 years... still fresh. There are so many things to appreciate about this song and video. From the suburb coloured garages to the parks  and then the change of mood near the end at night,  before sewing it up. Lyrics, music, bass line, video pauses...etc.. I love it.

Here's my take: This is about a toxic relationship. The red samurai is his wife. You can tell if you look carefully. The opening scene of him dueling his wife and his wife cutting off both of his arms is very symbolic. One of the things he does in his dream when he has arms again is play the piano. I'm interpreting this as him regretting starting a family with his wife who I would infer is probably emotionally and verbally abusive towards him - he may have sacrificed his dreams and ambition to become a family man for the wrong partner. This abusive attitude exhibited by his wife seems to have been inherited by his daughter too, who shuts off the TV when he requests that she change the channel.

He compared the black experience with gang life and the life you live later after it disables either physically, lawfully, or mentally. Using samurai as a correlation to us just being factions at war. Him being in blue and his opponent in red. Living after you‚Äôve made so many mistakes and watching your dreams be cut short because of those choices is the television scene. And the ending scene of another red and blue warrior cutting down another life and possible dream is just the recurring cycle of violence that we have in our communities. Really genius anime level type shit

My take with the lyrics and video in mind :
Its about falling into depression about something unrelated to your passion, which causes you to lose it unexpectedly. The 1st verse talks about a missing heart (passion for something you were born to do) and I think that's being emulated through the profession of the samurai and the mutilation scene is the theft of his heart. 2nd verse is almost like placing blame on the issues that clouded the samurai's brain (why in the world would I give my heart to you, just to watch you throw it in the trash/now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest, a broken heartless mess) the search to find himself is impossible because hes reveling in the fact that he is physically useless to his passion and he is just simply placing the blame on whatever spiraled his drive to find a new purpose down the drain.

the name and the theme are so symbolic. samurai lived by a code, and accepted death by combat as a means of an honorable death.. this man had to accept his life without that, and could not and become complacent, and his family threw him aside. i would love other opinions, but there is a lot of great symbolism here.

The song is about a person who gave everything they could into a relationship, just to realize the other person wasn't able to do the same. Later on, the heartless person now can't reciprocate for someone that wants to give everything they can to be with them, and they feel justified doing so. And so on and so on. The video I feel is something similar. He gave everything he can for what he loved most well past his prime, and he wishes he died that day instead of now being a burden and source of hate to the ones he fought every day for.

Them Changes,Thundercat,"Here's my take: This is about a toxic relationship. The red samurai is his wife. You can tell if you look carefully. The opening scene of him dueling his wife and his wife cutting off both of his arms is very symbolic. One of the things he does in his dream when he has arms again is play the piano. I'm interpreting this as him regretting starting a family with his wife who I would infer is probably emotionally and verbally abusive towards him - he may have sacrificed his dreams and ambition to become a family man for the wrong partner. This abusive attitude exhibited by his wife seems to have been inherited by his daughter too, who shuts off the TV when he requests that she change the channel.

Them Changes,Thundercat,"He compared the black experience with gang life and the life you live later after it disables either physically, lawfully, or mentally. Using samurai as a correlation to us just being factions at war. Him being in blue and his opponent in red. Living after you‚Äôve made so many mistakes and watching your dreams be cut short because of those choices is the television scene. And the ending scene of another red and blue warrior cutting down another life and possible dream is just the recurring cycle of violence that we have in our communities. Really genius anime level type shit",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCd_ERZvZM
Them Changes,Thundercat,"My take with the lyrics and video in mind :
Its about falling into depression about something unrelated to your passion, which causes you to lose it unexpectedly. The 1st verse talks about a missing heart (passion for something you were born to do) and I think that's being emulated through the profession of the samurai and the mutilation scene is the theft of his heart. 2nd verse is almost like placing blame on the issues that clouded the samurai's brain (why in the world would I give my heart to you, just to watch you throw it in the trash/now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest, a broken heartless mess) the search to find himself is impossible because hes reveling in the fact that he is physically useless to his passion and he is just simply placing the blame on whatever spiraled his drive to find a new purpose down the drain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCd_ERZvZM

The boy probably represents youth and the pure, free spirit of being young. When you grow up, it's hard to find that spirit again. You have to search for it.

In Arabic when we want to express how much we love and cherish someone we say ""you are my eyes"".. And for some reason that line ""don't you know you got my eyes"" makes me really nostalgic and sad.

My dad passed away in 2012 and now he communicates to me sometimes through songs. If I ask him a question the next song I hear will have the answer. This year I had to start my life over completely and I have moved across the country away from a toxic person, and then I moved again from the next place I lived from another toxic person, all during the pandemic. I am also legally blind and otherwise disabled so I worried about how I would make it on my own  after my  losses and divorce. I don't know anybody here and I'm completely alone. This comes after 10 years of loss and change that started with his death. Anyway, When I asked him how could I ever have a life again he sent me this song. He always does. I have been told he is my spirit guide and I can tell when he's here. I love glass animals

Vocalist/guitarist Dave Bayley explained the story behind this song to Paste magazine: ""The idea for this one came from a story someone told me once. They were telling me about their child, and something awful had happened to them. She was crying - but at the same time the memories that they had from that previous life made her so happy - so she was also smiling. That combination of emotions kind of made me feel like my heart was being ripped apart but also optimistic in a weird way. She had found a way to see happiness in this awful thing that had happened to her. That combination of emotions is what this song is getting at.""

I know no one cares about stuff like this but I just wanted to speak on the power of art because it‚Äôs beautiful. This video and this entire album has been a huge catalyst and help in me saving myself and my family. I was forcing my husband and 3 kids to live with my abusive parents so that I could try to make them love us before they died. All they did was hurt us more and instead of dealing with it I kept staying there and started doing pain pills. This video helped hit home how much I don‚Äôt need my parents and it made me never want to escape from my reality again. I hadn‚Äôt quite gotten to a stage of disgust, but I sure have done a lot of regrettable things. This album helps me have the strength to keep doing my best to learn to be better and to learn to be the best I can be for my kids. I don‚Äôt want to be held back by anything anymore and I don‚Äôt want to hold back my family. Thank you glass animal and crew:) your saving lives with this music

He was only 2 years old and 7 months when it happened. It was a short time for him but so many happy memories. They spent every single hour of every single day together. We‚Äôre so lost and devasted without you, We love you Deja C Rodriguez

I found this song the day after the funeral of my friend who I loved and trusted like a little brother and saying that is still an understatement of how much he meant to me, he died at only 11 years old , he was an optimist and knew where he was heading, he took others before himself and was the most selfless person I've met, he would always great me as his hyper self running down the stairs from his room and yelling ""VIIICCKKKKYYYYYYY""  my God I would have done anything to make him happy, and I did, I tried, to see him upset was to see the world crumble and yet the world seemed to go with him as a whole when he left.

this song is so heartbreaking. The first time i heard it i sobbed. my mother is so incredible and i imagine this is how she felt when i was sent to the hospital after my suicide attempt. mothers have to sit back after their child is raised and just hope for the best. they love from a distance and this song literally describes their desire for their child to ""be happy and free to run.""

Youth,Glass Animals,"In Arabic when we want to express how much we love and cherish someone we say ""you are my eyes"".. And for some reason that line ""don't you know you got my eyes"" makes me really nostalgic and sad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"As a mother whose had to let her son go for his life to be better, this song is about exactly that. The pain and sacrifice and love and the warm memories you pray they will have of the sweetest moments you've shared when you held them so long ago.. I miss you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,It‚Äôs been 3 years and I still can‚Äôt sing that chorus without tearing up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"My dad passed away in 2012 and now he communicates to me sometimes through songs. If I ask him a question the next song I hear will have the answer. This year I had to start my life over completely and I have moved across the country away from a toxic person, and then I moved again from the next place I lived from another toxic person, all during the pandemic. I am also legally blind and otherwise disabled so I worried about how I would make it on my own  after my  losses and divorce. I don't know anybody here and I'm completely alone. This comes after 10 years of loss and change that started with his death. Anyway, When I asked him how could I ever have a life again he sent me this song. He always does. I have been told he is my spirit guide and I can tell when he's here. I love glass animals",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,I lost my little sons to the care system because i had depression and experienced domestic abuse. I see them now sometimes. It doesn't get any easier and I miss them a lot. <3 This song means a lot. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"Vocalist/guitarist Dave Bayley explained the story behind this song to Paste magazine: ""The idea for this one came from a story someone told me once. They were telling me about their child, and something awful had happened to them. She was crying - but at the same time the memories that they had from that previous life made her so happy - so she was also smiling. That combination of emotions kind of made me feel like my heart was being ripped apart but also optimistic in a weird way. She had found a way to see happiness in this awful thing that had happened to her. That combination of emotions is what this song is getting at.""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"""Don't you know you got my eyes""

I don't know why but this really hit me",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,I hope the mother who inspired this can hear it and feel her child close to her again.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"Warning Ô∏è: 

The comment section is like the song. You'll find parts that hit you right in the feels and some parts that will make you smile.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"I know no one cares about stuff like this but I just wanted to speak on the power of art because it‚Äôs beautiful. This video and this entire album has been a huge catalyst and help in me saving myself and my family. I was forcing my husband and 3 kids to live with my abusive parents so that I could try to make them love us before they died. All they did was hurt us more and instead of dealing with it I kept staying there and started doing pain pills. This video helped hit home how much I don‚Äôt need my parents and it made me never want to escape from my reality again. I hadn‚Äôt quite gotten to a stage of disgust, but I sure have done a lot of regrettable things. This album helps me have the strength to keep doing my best to learn to be better and to learn to be the best I can be for my kids. I don‚Äôt want to be held back by anything anymore and I don‚Äôt want to hold back my family. Thank you glass animal and crew:) your saving lives with this music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,Why is nobody talking about this kid‚Äôs freakin‚Äô sweet dance moves?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,This is a rare thing... I like every song a band makes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"I always heard as if they were counting in the chorus  since they used phonetically similar words.  Even reading the lyrics I still hear it. Like:
ONE, i want you TWO be happy
THREE to run and dizzy on caffeine",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"Lyrics:[Verse 1]
Boy, when I left you you were young
I was gone, but not my love
You were clearly meant for more",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"I hope my son can find some type of solace or message in this song one day. We lost his mother my wife when she passed suddenly three months ago at 23 years young. He was only 2 years old and 7 months when it happened. It was a short time for him but so many happy memories. They spent every single hour of every single day together. We‚Äôre so lost and devasted without you, We love you Deja C Rodriguez",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,This song literally makes me cry every time I hear it it's just so sweet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"I cried watching this video, this is my first time seeing it.. It just reminded me of my mother,  how she raised me alone.  Seeing me happy and dancing all her life . How she works hard day by day just so I have a roof on my head and food on the table. She's amazing...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,their music is like being wrapped in a warm blanket on a chilly day.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"I found this song the day after the funeral of my friend who I loved and trusted like a little brother and saying that is still an understatement of how much he meant to me, he died at only 11 years old , he was an optimist and knew where he was heading, he took others before himself and was the most selfless person I've met, he would always great me as his hyper self running down the stairs from his room and yelling ""VIIICCKKKKYYYYYYY""  my God I would have done anything to make him happy, and I did, I tried, to see him upset was to see the world crumble and yet the world seemed to go with him as a whole when he left. Jesus Christ this song hits hard",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU

Youth,Glass Animals,"Escuch√© esta canci√≥n el 2017, y a√∫n vuelvo y vuelvo, simplemente gusto en escucharla. La primera vez que la escuch√© ten√≠a 12, actualmente tengo 16. Viendo un atardecer hermoso desde mi habitaci√≥n, simplemente recordando cuando ten√≠a 12 y no paraba de escucharla, en cierta manera me trae nostalgia y bellos recuerdos, espero volver dentro de 4 a√±os y recordar esta canci√≥n. Glass Animals es una banda incre√≠ble",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,I'll never stop loving this song. PERFECT.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU

Youth,Glass Animals,"this song is so heartbreaking. The first time i heard it i sobbed. my mother is so incredible and i imagine this is how she felt when i was sent to the hospital after my suicide attempt. mothers have to sit back after their child is raised and just hope for the best. they love from a distance and this song literally describes their desire for their child to ""be happy and free to run.""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,Still one of my favs Ô∏è I don't like the part of the mom leaving her son but the rest of the song reminds me of my little boy who I love more than anything on this planet and want nothing more than for him to have the best life possible.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
Youth,Glass Animals,"The first time I listened to this song, I thought it was such a beautiful, lively piece. But the more I listen to it, the darker and sadder it seems. Sometimes, inexplicably, I find myself breaking down to this song. The ‚Äúboy, I want you to be happy‚Äù part gets me every time. Also, that baby boy is so adorable Ô∏è",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdsmLgCVdU
