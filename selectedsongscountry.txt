__Title__Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)   Remastered By The Beatles__Title__

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
 She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood
 She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
 So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
 I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
 We talked until two and then she said, 
 She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
 I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
 And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
 So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood

__Title__50 Ways To Leave Your Lover By Paul Simon__Title__

The answer is easy if you take it logically
 I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
 There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
 She said, it's really not my habit to intrude
 Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
 But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
 There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
 Fifty ways to leave your lover
 You just slip out the back, Jack
 Make a new plan, Stan
 You don't need to be coy, Roy
 Just get yourself free
 Hop on the bus, Gus
 You don't need to discuss much
 Just drop off the key, Lee
 And get yourself free
 Ooo, slip out the back, Jack
 Make a new plan, Stan
 You don't need to be coy, Roy
 You just listen to me
 Hop on the bus, Gus
 You don't need to discuss much
 Just drop off the key, Lee
 And get yourself free
 She said, it grieves me so to see you in such pain
 I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
 I said, I appreciate that and would you please explain
 About the fifty ways
 She said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
 And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
 And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
 There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
 Fifty ways to leave your lover
 You just slip out the back, Jack
 Make a new plan, Stan
 You don't need to be coy, Roy
 Just get yourself free
 Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
 You don't need to discuss much
 Just drop off the key, Lee
 And get yourself free
 Slip out the back, Jack
 Make a new plan, Stan
 You don't need to be coy, Roy
 You just listen to me
 Hop on the bus, Gus
 You don't need to discuss much
 Just drop off the key, Lee
 And get yourself free

 Music 
 I'm sitting in the railway station
 Got a ticket to my destination
 On a tour of one
 And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one
 Homeward bound,
 I wish I was,
 Homeward bound,
 Home where my thought's escaping,
 Home where my music's playing,
 Home where my love lies waiting
 Silently for me
 Ev'ry day's an endless stream
 Of cigarettes and magazines
 And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
 And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
 Homeward bound,
 I wish I was,
 Homeward bound,
 Home where my thought's escaping,
 Home where my music's playing,
 Home where my love lies waiting
 Silently for me
 Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
 I'll play the game and pretend
 But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
 Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me
 Homeward bound,
 I wish I was,
 Homeward bound,
 Home where my thought's escaping,
 Home where my music's playing,
 Home where my love lies waiting
 Silently for me
 Silently for me

Little darlin', it seems like a long cold lonely winter
 Little darlin', it seems like so many years since it's been there
 Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
 And I say, 
 It's all right, it's all right
 Little darlin', it seems like, the ice is slowly melting
 Little darlin', it seems like so years since it's been there
 Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
 And I say, 
 It's all right, it's all right
 Little darlin', it seems like the smiles are returnin' to the faces
 Little darlin', it seems like so many years since they've been there
 Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
 And I say, 
 It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
 Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
 And I say, 
 It's all right, it's all right, it's all right

 Will be equal to the love you gave

 Feeling two

 And I hear them say
 Hey you've got to hide your love away
 Hey you've got to hide your love away

 Hearing them, seeing them
 In the state I'm in

 You would come around to my way any day
 As time went on you just stayed the same
 No you, you couldn't change or be rearranged

__Title__Vincent By Don Mclean__Title__

Starry, starry night
 Paint your palette blue and gray
 Look out on a summer's day
 With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
 Shadows on the hills
 Sketch the trees and the daffodils
 Catch the breeze and the winter chills
 In colors on the snowy linen land
 Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
 And how you suffered for your sanity
 And how you tried to set them free
 They would not listen, they did not know how
 Perhaps they'll listen now
 Starry, starry night
 Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
 Swirling clouds in violet haze
 Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
 Colors changing hue
 Morning fields of amber grain
 Weathered faces lined in pain
 Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
 Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
 And how you suffered for your sanity
 And how you tried to set them free
 They would not listen, they did not know how
 Perhaps they'll listen now
 For they could not love you
 But still your love was true
 And when no hope was left inside
 On that starry, starry night
 You took your life as lovers often do
 But I could have told you, Vincent
 This world was never meant for one
 As beautiful as you
 Starry, starry night
 Portraits hung in empty halls
 Frame less heads on nameless walls
 With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
 Like the strangers that you've met
 The ragged men in ragged clothes
 The silver thorn of bloody rose
 Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
 Now, I think I know what you tried to say to me
 And how you suffered for your sanity
 And how you tried to set them free
 They would not listen, they're not listening still
 Perhaps they never will

There are places I remember,
 all my life, though some have changed
 some forever not for better,
 some have gone, and some remain,
 all these places have their moments,
 with lovers and friends, I still can recall,
 some are dead and some are living,
 In My Life, I've loved them all
 But of all these friends and lovers,
 there is no one, compares with you,
 and these memories lose thier meaning,
 when I think of love, as something new
 though I know I'll never lose affection,
 for people and things, that went before
 I know I'll often stop and think about them,
 In My Life, I love you more
 though I know I'll never lose affection,
 for people and things, that went before
 I know I'll often stop and think about them,
 In My Life, I love you more
 In My Life, I love you more
 
__Title__Shelter From The Storm By Bob Dylan__Title__

Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
 Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
 I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
 Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
 Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
 Try imagining a place where its always safe and warm
 I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
 Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail
 Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
 Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
 With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
 She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
 And the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount
 Nothing really matters much, doom alone that counts
 And the one
 In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
 I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose
 I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn
 Now theres a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
 I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
 Just to think that it all began on a long
 I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
 Beauty walks a razors edge, someday I'll make it mine
 I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
 
__Title__Fire And Rain By James Taylor__Title__

Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
 Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
 I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
 I just can't remember who to send it to
 I've seen fire and I've seen rain
 I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
 I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
 But I always thought that I'd see you again
 Won't you look down upon me, jesus
 You've got to help me make a stand
 You've just got to see me through another day
 My body's aching and my time is at hand
 And I won't make it any other way
 Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
 I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
 I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
 But I always thought that I'd see you again
 Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
 Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
 Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
 To come
 Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
 I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
 I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
 But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
 Thought I'd see you one more time again
 There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
 Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now

 Cathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
 Michigan seems like a dream to me now
 It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
 I've gone to look for America
 Laughing on the bus playing games with the faces
 She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
 I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera
 Toss me a cigaret I think there's one in the raincoat
 We smoked the last one an hour ago
 So I looked at the scenary she read her magazine
 And the moon rose over an open field
 Cathy I'm lost I said though I knew she was sleeping

 Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike

She can kill with a smile
 She can wound with her eyes
 And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
 And she only reveals what she wants you to see
 She hides like a child
 But she's always a woman to me
 She can lead you to love
 She can take you or leave you
 She can ask for the truth
 But she'll never believe you
 And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
 Yeah, she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me
 Oh, she takes care of herself
 She can wait if she wants
 She's ahead of her time
 Oh, and she never gives out
 And she never gives in
 She just changes her mind
 And she'll promise you more than the Garden of Eden
 Then she'll carelessly cut you
 And laugh while you're bleedin'
 But she'll bring out the best
 And the worst you can be
 Blame it all on yourself
 'Cause she's always a woman to me
 Oh, she takes care of herself
 She can wait if she wants
 She's ahead of her time
 Oh, and she never gives out
 And she never gives in
 She just changes her mind
 She is frequently kind
 And she's suddenly cruel
 But she can do as she pleases
 She's nobody's fool
 And she can't be convicted
 She's earned her degree
 And the most she will do
 Is throw shadows at you
 But she's always a woman to me

 Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
 Can I handle the seasons of my life
 Well, I've been afraid of changing
 'Cause I've built my life around you
 But time makes you bolder
 Even children get older, and I'm getting older too
 Well, I've been afraid of changing

 I am just a poor boy
 Though my story's seldom told
 I have squandered my resistance
 For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
 All lies and jests
 Still a man hears what he wants to hear
 And disregards the rest
 When I left my home and my family
 I was no more than a boy
 In the company of strangers
 In the quiet of the railway station running scared
 Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
 Where the ragged people go
 Looking for the places only they would know
 Lie la lie 
 Asking only workman's wages
 I come looking for a job
 But I get no offers,
 Just a come
 I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
 I took some comfort there
 Lie la lie 
 Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
 And wishing I was gone
 Going home
 Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
 Bleeding me, going home
 In the clearing stands a boxer
 And a fighter by his trade
 And he carries the reminders
 Of ev'ry glove that layed him down
 Or cut him till he cried out
 In his anger and his shame
 But the fighter still remains
 Lie la lie

 Sail away, kill off the hours

 Run away, find you a lover
 Go away somewhere bright and new

 Who compares with you
 You belong among the wildflowers
 You belong in a boat out at sea
 You belong with your love on your arm
 You belong somewhere you feel free
 Run away, go find a lover
 Run away, let your heart be your guide
 You deserve the deepest of cover
 You belong in that home by and by
 You belong among the wildflowers
 You belong somewhere close to me
 Far away from your trouble and worry
 You belong somewhere you feel free

 Hey that's me and I want you only
 Don't turn me home again
 I just can't face myself alone again
 Well, don't you run back inside, darling
 You know just what I'm here for
 So you're scared and you're thinking
 That maybe, we ain't that young anymore
 Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
 Ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright
 Oh yeah, and that's alright with me
 You can hide 'neath your covers
 And study your pain
 Make crosses from your lovers
 Throw roses in the rain
 Waste your summer praying in vain
 For a savior to rise from these streets
 Well, I'm no hero, that's understood
 All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
 With a chance to make it good somehow
 Hey, what else can we do now
 Except roll down the window
 And let the wind blow back your hair
 Well, the night's busted open
 These two lanes will take us anywhere
 We got one last chance to make it real
 To trade in these wings on some wheels
 Climb in back, Heaven's waiting down on the tracks
 Well, oh oh, come take my hand
 We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
 Oh oh, thunder road, oh thunder road, oh thunder road
 Lying out there, like a killer in the sun
 Hey I know it's late, but we can make it if we run
 Oh oh, thunder road, sit tight take hold, thunder road
 Well, I got this guitar, and I learned how to make it talk
 And my car's out back, if you're ready to take that long walk
 From your front porch to my front seat
 The door's open but the ride, it ain't free
 And I know you're lonely
 For words that I ain't spoken
 But tonight we'll be free
 All the promises'll be broken
 There were ghosts in the eyes
 Of all the boys you sent away
 They haunt this dusty beach road
 In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
 They scream your name at night in the street
 Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
 And in the lonely cool before dawn
 You hear their engines roaring on
 But when you get to the porch, they're gone
 On the wind, so Mary climb in
 It's a town full of losers
 Then we're pulling out of here to win
 
__Title__Maggie May   Remastered Version By Rod Stewart__Title__

Wake up Maggie
 I think I got something to say to you
 it's late September and I really should be back at school
 I know I keep you amused
 but I feel I'm being used
 oh
 Maggie
 I couldn't have tried anymore
 You led me away from home
 just to save you from being alone
 You stole my heart and that's what really hurts
 The morning sun
 when it's in your face
 really shows your age
 but that don't worry me none
 in my eyes you're everything
 I laughed at all of your jokes
 my love you didn't need to coax
 oh
 Maggie
 I couldn't have tried anymore
 You led me away from home
 just to save you from being alone
 You stole my soul
 that's a pain I can do without
 All I needed was a friend, to lend, a guiding hand
 but you turned into a lover
 and
 Mother
 what a lover!
 You wore me out
 All you did was wreck my bed
 and in the morning kick me in the head
 oh
 Maggie
 I couldn't have tried anymore
 You led me away from home
 'cause you didn't want to be alone
 You stole my heart
 I couldn't leave you if I tried
 I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
 Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
 Or find myself a rock and roll band, that needs a helpin' hand
 Oh
 Maggie
 I wish I'd never seen your face
 you made a first
 but I'm as blind as a fool can be
 you stole my heart but I love you anyway
 Maggie
 I wished I'd never seen your face
 I'll get on back home, one of these days
 
__Title__Your Song By Elton John__Title__

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
 But I'm, I'm not one of those who can easily hide
 I, I don't have much money but boy if I did
 I'd buy a big house where we both could live
 If I was a sculptor but, but then again, no
 Or a man who makes potions in a traveling shows
 I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
 My gift is my song and this one's for you
 And you can tell everybody this is your song
 It may be quite simple but now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 That I put down in words
 How wonderful life is while you're in the world
 I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
 Well a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
 But the sun's been kind while I wrote this song
 It's for people like you that keep it turned on
 So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
 You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
 Anyway the thing is what I really mean
 Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
 So you can tell everybody this is your song
 It may be quite simple but now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 That I put down in words
 How wonderful life is while you're in the world
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 That I put down in words
 How wonderful life is while you're in the world
 
__Title__Stuck In The Middle With You By Stealers Wheel__Title__

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
 I got the feeling that something ain't right
 I'm so scared, in case I fall off my chair
 And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
 Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
 Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
 Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
 And I'm wondering what it is I should do
 It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
 Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
 Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
 Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
 Well, you started off with nothing
 And you're proud that you're a self
 And your friends, they all come crawlin'
 Slap you on the back and say, ½Please, please
 Trying to make some sense of it all
 But I can see it makes no sense at all
 Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
 Well, I don't think that I can take anymore
 Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
 Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
 Well, you started out with nothing
 And you're proud that you're a self
 And your friends, they all come crawlin'
 Slap you on the back and say, ½Please, please
 Yeah, I don't know why I came here tonight
 I got the feeling that something ain't right
 I'm so scared, in case I fall off my chair
 And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
 Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
 Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
 Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
 Stuck in the middle with you
 Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
 
__Title__Ruby Tuesday By The Rolling Stones__Title__

She would never say where she came from
 Yesterday don't matter when it's gone
 While the sun is bright
 Or in the darkest night
 No one knows
 She comes and goes
 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
 Who could hang a name on you
 When you smile with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you
 Don't question why she needs to be so free
 She'll tell you it's the only way to be
 She just can't be chained
 To a life where nothing's gained
 And nothing's lost
 At such a cost
 There's no time to lose, I heard her say
 Catch your dreams before they slip away
 Dying all the time
 Lose your dreams
 And you will lose your mind
 Ain't life unkind
 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
 Who could hang a name on you
 When you smile with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you
 
__Title__Clay Pigeons By John Prine__Title__

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station gonna get a ticket to ride
 Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
 Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
 Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
 Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet and get along with it all
 Go down where the people say 
 Sing a song with a friend, change the shape that I'm in
 And get back in the game and start playin' again
 I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
 Might go back down to Texas, might go to somewhere that I've never been
 And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
 And I won't have to go home, get used to bein' alone
 Change the words to this song, start singin' again
 I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers to questions that I already know
 It could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
 Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
 Feed the pigeons some clay, turn the night into day
 Start talkin' again, when I know what to say
 I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna get a ticket to ride
 Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
 Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
 Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
 Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet and get along with it all
 Go down where the people say 
 Feed the pigeons some clay, turn the night into day
 Start talkin' again when I know what to say
 
__Title__Where Do You Go To (My Lovely) [Re Recorded] By Peter Sarstedt__Title__

You talk like Marlene Dietrich
 And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
 Your clothes are all made by Balmain
 And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are
 You live in a fancy apartment
 Off the Boulevard of St
 Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
 And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do
 You go to the embassy parties
 Where you talk in Russian and Greek
 And the young men who move in your circles
 They hang on every word you speak, yes they do
 But where do you go to my lovely
 When you're alone in your bed
 Tell me the thoughts that surround you
 I want to look inside your head, yes I do
 I've seen all your qualifications
 You got from the Sorbonne
 And the painting you stole from Picasso
 Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does
 When you go on your summer vacation
 You go to Juan
 With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
 You get an even suntan, on your back and on your legs
 And when the snow falls you're found in St
 With the others of the jet
 And you sip your Napoleon Brandy
 But you never get your lips wet, no you don't
 But where do you go to my lovely
 When you're alone in your bed
 Tell me the thoughts that surround you
 I want to look inside your head, yes I do
 You're in between 20 and 30
 A very desirable age
 Your body is firm and inviting
 But you live on a glittering stage, yes you do, yes you do
 Your name is heard in high places
 You know the Aga Khan
 He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
 And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh ha
 They say that when you get married
 It'll be to a millionaire
 But they don't realize where you came from
 And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn
 But where do you go to my lovely
 When you're alone in your bed
 Tell me the thoughts that surround you
 I want to look inside your head, yes i do
 I remember the back streets of Naples
 Two children begging in rags
 Both touched with a burning ambition
 To shake off their lowly
 So look into my face Marie
 And remember just who you are
 Then go and forget me forever
 But I know you still bear
 the scar, deep inside, yes you do
 I know where you go to my lovely
 When you're alone in your bed
 I know the thoughts that surround you
 'Cause I can look inside your head
 
__Title__Diamonds And Rust By Joan Baez__Title__

Well I'll be damned here comes your ghost again
 But that's not unusual
 It's just that the moon is full
 And you happened to call
 And here I sit hand on the telephone
 Hearing a voice I'd known
 A couple of light years ago
 Heading straight for a fall
 As I remember your eyes were bluer than robin's eggs
 My poetry was lousy you said
 Where are you calling from
 A booth in the midwest
 Ten years ago I bought you some cufflinks
 You brought me something
 We both know what memories can bring
 They bring diamonds and rust
 Well you burst on the scene already a legend
 The unwashed phenomenon
 The original vagabond
 You strayed into my arms
 And there you stayed temporarily lost at sea
 The Madonna was yours for free
 Yes the girl on the half
 Would keep you unharmed
 Now I see you standing with brown leaves falling around
 Snow in your hair
 Now you're smiling out the window
 Of that crummy hotel over Washington Square
 Our breath comes out white clouds
 Mingles and hangs in the air
 Speaking strictly for me
 We both could have died then and there
 Now you're telling me, you're not nostalgic
 Then give me another word for it
 You are so good with words
 And at keeping things vague
 Because I need some of that vagueness now
 It's all come back too clearly, yes I loved you dearly
 And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
 I've already paid

She packed my bags last night pre
 Zero hour, nine a
 And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
 I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
 It's lonely out in space
 On such a timeless flight
 And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me round again to find
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
 Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
 Till touch town brings me round again to find
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
 Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
 In fact, it's cold as hell
 And there's no one there to raise them if you did
 And all this science I don't understand
 It's just my job five days a week, a rocket man, a rocket man
 And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me round again to find
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
 Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me round again to find
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
 Rock man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
 And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

When you're wide awake say it for goodness sake
 It's gonna be a great day
 While you're standing there get up and grab a chair
 It's gonna be a great day
 And it won't be long, oh no
 It won't be long, it won't be long, no no

 It won't be long, it won't be long, oh
 Ooh, ooh, yeah

 It won't be long, it won't be long, no no

 It won't be long, it won't be long, ooh yeah
 When you're wide awake say it for goodness sake
 It's gonna be a great day
 While you're standing there, get up and grab a chair
 It's gonna be a great day
 
__Title__Angel From Montgomery By Bonnie Raitt__Title__

I am an old woman
 Named after my mother
 An old man is another
 Child who's grown old
 If dreams were thunder
 Lightning was desire
 This old house it would've burned down
 A long time ago
 Make me an angel
 That flies from Montgomery
 Make me a poster
 Of an old rodeo
 Just give me one thing
 That I can hold on to
 To believe in this livin'
 Is just a hard way to go
 When I was a young girl
 I had me a cowboy
 It wasn't much to look at
 It was a free ramblin' man
 There was a long time
 No matter how I tried
 The years they just rolled by
 Like a broken down dance
 Make me an angel
 That flies from Montgomery
 Make me a poster
 Of an old rodeo
 Just give me one thing
 I can hold on to
 Believe in this livin'
 Is just a hard
 There's flies in the kitchen
 I can hear them there buzzin'
 And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
 But how the hell can a person
 Go on to work in the mornin'
 To come home in the evenin'
 And have nothing to say
 Make me an angel
 That flies from Montgomery
 Make me a poster
 Of an old rodeo
 Just give me one thing
 That I can hold on to
 To believe in this livin'
 Is just a hard way to go
 
__Title__1952 Vincent Black Lightning By Richard Thompson__Title__

Oh, says Red Molly to James, 
 A girl could feel special on any such like
 Says James to Red Molly, 
 It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952
 And I've seen you at the corners and cafes it seems
 Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme
 And he pulled her on behind
 And down to Box Hill, they did ride
 Oh, says James to Red Molly, 
 But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man
 For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen
 I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine
 Now I'm twenty
 And I don't mind dying, but for the love of you
 And if fate should break my stride
 Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride
 Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside
 Oh, come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside
 When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left
 He was running out of road, he was running out of breath
 But he smiled to see her cry
 And said I'll give you my Vincent to ride
 Says James, 
 Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl
 Now Nortons and Indians and Greeves's won't do
 Ahh, they don't have a soul like a Vincent 52
 Oh, he reached for her hand then he slipped her the keys
 He said, 
 I see angels on Ariels, in leather and chrome
 Swooping down from heaven to carry me home
 And he gave her one last kiss and died
 And he gave her his Vincent to ride

May you never lay your head down
 Without a hand to hold
 May you never make your bed
 Out in the cold
 You're just like a great strong brother of mine
 And you know that I love you true
 You never talk dirty behind my back
 And I know there are those that do
 Won't you please, won't you please
 Won't you bear in mind
 Love is a lesson to learn in our time
 Won't you please, won't you please
 Won't you bear in mind for me
 May you never lay your head down
 Without a hand to hold
 May you never make your bed
 Out in the cold
 And you're just like a good close sister to me
 And you know that I love you true
 You hold no blade to stab me in the back
 And I know that some do
 Won't you please, won't you please
 Won't you bear in mind
 Love is a lesson to learn in our time
 Won't you please, won't you please
 Won't you bear it mind for me
 May you never lay your head down
 Without a hand to hold
 May you never make your bed
 Out in the cold
 You're just like a great strong brother of mine
 And you know that I love you true
 You never talk dirty behind my back
 And I know there are those that do
 Won't you please, won't you please
 Won't you bear in mind
 Love is a lesson to learn in our time
 Won't you please, won't you please
 Won't you bear in mind for me
 May you never lose your temper
 If you get hit in a bar room fight
 May you never lose
 Your woman overnight
 May you never lay your head down
 Without a hand to hold
 May you never make your bed
 Out in the cold
 May you never lose your temper
 If you get hit in a bar room fight
 May you never lose
 Your woman overnight
 May you never lose your temper
 If you get hit in a bar room fight
 May you never lose
 Your woman overnight
 May you never lose your temper
 If you get hit in a bar room fight
 May you never lose
 Your woman overnight

Hey Mr
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
 Hey Mr
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
 Though I know that evening's empire
 Has returned into sand, vanished from my hand
 Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
 My weariness amazes me
 I'm branded on my feet, I have no one to meet
 And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
 Hey Mr
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
 Hey Mr
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
 My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
 My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
 To be wanderin'
 I'm ready to go anywhere
 I'm ready for to fade into my own parade
 Cast your dancing spell my way
 I promise to go under it
 Hey Mr
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
 Hey Mr
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
 Though you might hear laughin'
 Spinnin', swingin' madly through the sun
 It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
 And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
 And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
 To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
 I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow
 You're seein' that he's chasing
 Hey Mr
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
 Hey Mr
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
 Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
 Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
 The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
 Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
 Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
 Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
 With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
 Let me forget about today until tomorrow
 Hey Mr
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
 Hey Mr
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Who draws the crowd and plays so loud, baby it's the guitar man
 Who's gonna steal the show, you know baby it's the guitar man
 He can make you love, he can make you cry
 He will bring you down then he'll get you high
 Somethin' keeps him goin' miles and miles a day
 To find another place to play
 Night after night who treats you right, baby it's the guitar man
 Who's on the radio, you go listen to the guitar man
 Then he comes to town and you see his face
 And you think you might like to take his place
 Somethin' keeps him driftin' miles and miles away
 Searchin' for the songs to play
 Then you listen to the music and you like to sing along
 You want to get the meaning out of each and every song
 Then you find yourself a message and some words
 To call your own and take them home
 He can make you love, he can get you high
 He will bring you down then he'll make you cry
 Somethin' keeps him movin' but no one seems to know
 What it is that makes him go
 Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim
 The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
 But he never seems to notice he's just got to find
 Another place to play,  Anyway  Got to play, anyway  Got to play

I still love you
 I still want you
 I still need you
 Don't hang up and say goodbye
 Walking on the beach last night and hoping things would be alright
 But later lying on her bed, it's you I saw instead
 Thinkin' of the one I love, you know what I'm thinkin' of
 San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
 I met a girl in Mexico and should have told her then I know
 That I still think of you we never will be through
 San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
 San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
 I still love you
 I still want you
 I still need you
 Don't hang up and say goodbye
 Walking down on Market Street
 And feeling my heart skip a beat
 To see someone that looks like you
 I guess that I'm not through
 Dreaming of the one I love
 You know what I'm dreaming of
 San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
 I'm headed for that Golden Gate
 And hoping I won't be too late
 To find the one that I still love
 It's you I'm dreaming of
 San Francisco nights
 San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
 San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
 San Francisco, San Francisco
 San Francisco nights, San Francisco
 San Francisco, San Francisco
 
__Title__Suzanne By Leonard Cohen__Title__

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
 You can hear the boats go by
 You can spend the night beside her
 And you know that she's half crazy
 But that's why you want to be there
 And she feeds you tea and oranges
 That come all the way from China
 And just when you mean to tell her
 That you have no love to give her
 Then she gets you on her wavelength
 And she lets the river answer
 That you've always been her lover
 And you want to travel with her
 And you want to travel blind
 And you know that she will trust you
 For you've touched her perfect body with your mind
 And Jesus was a sailor
 When he walked upon the water
 And he spent a long time watching
 From his lonely wooden tower
 And when he knew for certain
 Only drowning men could see him
 He said, 
 Until the sea shall free them
 But he himself was broken
 Long before the sky would open
 Forsaken, almost human
 He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
 And you want to travel with him
 And you want to travel blind
 And you think maybe you'll trust him
 For he's touched your perfect body with his mind
 Now Suzanne takes your hand
 And she leads you to the river
 She is wearing rags and feathers
 From Salvation Army counters
 And the sun pours down like honey
 On our lady of the harbor
 And she shows you where to look
 Among the garbage and the flowers
 There are heroes in the seaweed
 There are children in the morning
 They are leaning out for love
 And they will lean that way forever while Suzanne holds the mirror
 And you want to travel with her
 And you want to travel blind
 And you know that you can trust her
 For she's touched your perfect body with her mind
