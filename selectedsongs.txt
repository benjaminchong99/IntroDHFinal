Misery Business By Paramore

I'm in the business of misery
 let's take it from the top
 She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
 It's a matter of time before we all run out
 When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
 I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
 I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
 Two weeks and we had caught on fire
 She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But, God, does it feel so good
 Cause I got him where I want him now
 And if you could, then you know you would
 Cause, God, it just feels so
 It just feels so good
 Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
 Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
 And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
 I'm sorry, honey, but I'm past that, now look this way
 Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
 Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
 They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
 Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But, God, does it feel so good
 Cause I got him where I want him right now
 And if you could, then you know you would
 Cause, God, it just feels so
 It just feels so good
 I watched his wildest dreams come true
 Not one of them involving you
 Just watch my wildest dreams come true
 Not one of them involving
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But, God, does it feel so good
 Cause I got him where I want him now
 And if you could, then you know you would
 Cause, God, it just feels so
 It just feels so good
 
Helena By My Chemical Romance

Long ago
 Just like the hearse, you die to get in again
 We are so far from you
 Burning on
 Just like a match you strike to incinerate
 The lives of everyone you know
 And what's the worst you take 
 From every heart you break 
 And like a blade you stain 
 Well, I've been holding on tonight
 What's the worst that I could say
 Things are better if I stay
 So long and goodnight
 So long and goodnight
 Came a time
 When every star fall
 Brought you to tears again
 We are the very hurt you sold
 And what's the worst you take 
 From every heart you break 
 And like the blade you stain 
 Well, I've been holding on tonight
 What's the worst that I could say
 Things are better if I stay
 So long and goodnight
 So long and goodnight
 Well, if you carry on this way
 Things are better if I stay
 So long and goodnight
 So long not goodnight
 Can you hear me
 Are you near me
 Can we pretend
 To leave and then
 We'll meet again
 When both our cars collide
 What's the worst that I could say
 Things are better if I stay
 So long and goodnight
 So long not goodnight
 Well, if you carry on this way
 Things are better if I stay
 So long and goodnight
 So long and goodnight
 
I'M Not Okay By My Chemical Romance

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
 I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way
 For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
 Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 You wear me out
 What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
 I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
 To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
 I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 You wear me out
 Forget about the dirty looks
 The photographs your boyfriend took
 You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed
 I'm okay
 I'm okay!
 I'm okay, now
 But you really need to listen to me
 Because I'm telling you the truth
 I mean this, I'm okay!
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 Well, I'm not okay
 I'm not o
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 
I Miss You By Blink 182

I miss you
 Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
 The shadow in the background of the morgue
 The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
 We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
 Where you can always find me
 And we'll have halloween on Christmas
 And in the night we'll wish this never ends
 We'll wish this never ends
 I miss you, miss you
 I miss you, miss you
 Where are you and I'm so sorry
 I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
 I need somebody and always
 This sick, strange darkness
 Comes creeping on so haunting everytime
 And as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders
 Catching things and eating their insides
 Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason
 Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
 Stop this pain tonight
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 
Face Down By The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus

Hey, girl, you know you drive me crazy
 one look puts the rhythm in my hand
 Still I'll never understand why you hang around
 I see what's going down
 Cover up with makeup in the mirror
 tell yourself, it's never gonna happen again
 You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
 Do you feel like a man when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 as your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
 A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
 every action in this world will bear a consequence
 If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
 I see what's going down
 I see the way you go and say you're right again,
 say you're right again
 Heed my lecture
 Do you feel like a man when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 as your lies crumble down, a new life she has
 One day she will tell you that she has had enough
 It's coming round again
 Do you feel like a man when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 as your lies crumble down, a new life she has
 Face down in the dirt, she said,
 
Thnks Fr Th Mmrs By Fall Out Boy

I'm gonna make it bend and break
   
 Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
 In case God doesn't show
   
 And I want these words to make things right
 But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
 If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys
 One night and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Thanks for the memories
 See he tastes like you only sweeter
 I'm looking forward to the future
 But my eyesight is going bad
 And this crystal ball
 It's always cloudy except for, except for
 When you look into the past, look into the past
 One night stand
 One night stand
 One night and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Thanks for the memories
 See he tastes like you only sweeter
 They say I only think in the form of
 Crunching numbers in hotel rooms
 Collecting page six lovers
 Get me out of my mind
 Gets you out of those clothes
 I'm a liner away from
 Getting you into the mood
 One night and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time
 Thanks for the memories
 Thanks for the memories
 See he tastes like you only sweeter
 One night and one more time
   
 Thanks for the memories
 Even though they weren't so great
 He tastes like you only sweeter
 One night yeah, and one more time
   
 Thanks for the memories
 Thanks for the memories
 See he tastes like you only sweeter
 
The Anthem By Good Charlotte

Yeah, here we go
 It's a new day, but it all feels old
 It's a good life, that's what I'm told
 But everything, it all just feels the same
 And my high school, it felt more to me
 Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
 My time spent there, it only made me see
 That I don't ever wanna be like you
 I don't wanna do the things you do
 I'm never gonna hear the words you say
 And I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 You
 Don't wanna be you
 Go to college, a university
 Get a real job, that's what they said to me
 But I could never live the way they want
 I'm gonna get by and just do my time
 Out of step while they all get in line
 I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
 Do you really wanna be like them
 Do you really wanna be another trend
 Do you wanna be part of their crowd
 'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 You
 Don't wanna be you
 Shake it once, that's fine
 Shake it twice, that's okay
 Shake it three times
 You're playing with yourself again
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
 You
 Don't wanna be just like you
 This is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
 Another loser anthem, woah
 Another loser anthem, woah
 Another loser anthem, woah
 Another loser anthem
 
Numb By Linkin Park

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
 Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
 I don't know what you're expecting of me
 Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Become so tired, so much more aware
 I'm becoming this, all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 Can't you see that you're smothering me
 Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
 'Cause everything that you thought I would be
 Has fallen apart right in front of you
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
 Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
 And every second I waste is more than I can take
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Become so tired, so much more aware
 I'm becoming this, all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 And I know I may end up failing too
 But I know, you were just like me
 With someone disappointed in you
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Become so tired, so much more aware
 I'm becoming this, all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Tryin' to be what you want me to be
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
 Tryin' to be what you want me to be
 
Ocean Avenue By Yellowcard

There's a place off Ocean Avenue
 Where I used to sit and talk with you
 We were both 16 and it felt so right
 Sleeping all day staying up all night
 Staying up all night
 There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
 We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
 We were both 18 and it felt so right
 Sleeping all day staying up all night
 Staying up all night
 If I could find you now things would get better
 We could leave this town and run forever
 Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
 There's a piece of you thats here with me
 It's everywhere I go its everything I see
 When I sleep I dream and it gets me by
 I can make believe that you're here tonight
 That you're here tonight
 If I could find you now things would get better
 We could leave this town and run forever
 I know somewhere somehow we'll be together
 Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
 I remember the look in your eyes
 When I told you that this was goodbye
 You were begging me not tonight
 Not here, not now
 We're looking up at the same night sky
 And keep pretending the sun will not rise
 Well be together for one more night somewhere somehow
 If I could find you now things would get better
 We could leave this town and run forever
 I know somewhere somehow we'll be together
 Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
 
Miserable At Best By Mayday Parade

Katie, don't cry, I know
 You're trying your hardest
 And the hardest part is letting go
 Of the nights we shared
 Ocala is calling
 And you know it's haunting
 But compared
 To your eyes,
 Nothing shines
 Quite as bright
 And when we look to the sky,
 It's not mine,
 But I want it so
 Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
 You're probably hanging out and making eyes
 I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
 And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
 Because these words were never easier for me to say
 Or her to second guess
 But I guess
 That I can live without you but
 Without you I'll be miserable at best
 You're all that I hoped to find
 In every single way
 And everything I would give
 Is everything you couldn't take
 'Cause nothing feels like home,
 You're a thousand miles away
 And the hardest part of living
 Is just taking breaths to stay
 'Cause I know I'm good for something
 I just haven't found it yet
 But I need it
 So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
 You're probably hanging out and making eyes
 I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
 And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
 Because these words were never easier for me to say
 Or her to second guess
 But I guess
 That I can live without you but
 Without you I'll be miserable at best
 Ladada ladada ladadaoh ohhh
 And this'll be the first time in a week
 That I'll talk to you
 And I can't speak
 It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
 'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
 And I got the point that I should leave you alone
 But we both know that I'm not that strong
 And I miss the lips that made me fly
 So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
 You're probably hanging out and making eyes
 I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
 And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
 Because these words were never easier for me to say
 Or her to second guess
 But I guess
 That I can live without you but
 Without you I'll be miserable
 And I can live without you
 But without you I'll be miserable
 And I can live without you
 Oh, without you I'll be miserable at best
 
If You Can'T Hang By Sleeping With Sirens

Met a girl at seventeen
 Thought she meant the world to me,
 So I gave her everything,
 She turned out to be a cheat
 Said she'd been thinking for a long time
 And she found somebody new
 I've been thinking that this whole time
 Well I never thought you'd stay
 I hope he takes your filthy heart
 And then he throws you away someday
 Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know
 If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
 If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
 If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
 If you can't hang then, there's the door
 I don't wanna take your precious time
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
 But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
 I don't wanna take up all your time
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
 But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
 You're the lowest type
 You're the lowest
 I met a girl stuck in her ways
 She found a boy she knew she'd change
 I changed my clothes, my hair, my face
 To watch us go our separate ways
 She said we've grown apart for sometime
 I hope Mr
 Stay the hell away,
 While I sit here by myself
 And figure out how I got this way
 Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know
 If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
 If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
 If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
 If you can't hang then, there's the door
 I don't wanna take your precious time
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
 But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
 I don't wanna take up all your time
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
 But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
 I don't want to get things confused
 She said she'd never settle for some boy she couldn't use
 So now I gotta call the doctor
 So he can prescribe me medication
 So I can deal with all the memories of being here this way
 I met a girl at twenty
 Knew she meant the world to me,
 So I gave her everything,
 And she did the same for me
 Imagine that!
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face
 No you're such a pretty, pretty face
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face
 No you're such a pretty, pretty face
 I don't wanna take your precious time
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
 But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
 I don't wanna take up all your time
 'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
 But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
 Would you please stay and come inside, baby
 Would you please stay and please be mine, baby
 Would you please stay and come inside, baby
 Would you please stay and please be mine
 
First Date By Blink 182

In the car, I just can't wait
 To pick you up on our very first date
 Is it cool if I hold your hand
 Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance
 Do you like my stupid hair
 Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear
 I'm just scared of what you'll think
 You make me nervous so I really can't eat
 Let's go, don't wait, this nights almost over
 Honest, let's make, this night last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 When you smile, I melt inside
 I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
 I really wish it was only me and you
 I'm jealous of everybody in the room
 Please don't look at me with those eyes
 Please don't hint that your capable of lies
 I dreamt the thought of our very first kiss
 A target that I'm probably gonna miss
 Let's go, don't wait, this nights almost over
 Honest, let's make, this night last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 Let's go, don't wait, this nights almost over
 Honest, let's make, this night last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
 Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
