__Title__A Thousand Miles By Vanessa Carlton__Title__

Making my way downtown, walking fast
 Faces pass and I'm home bound
 Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
 Making a way through the crowd
 And I need you
 And I miss you
 And now I wonder
 If I could fall into the sky
 Do you think time would pass me by
 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
 If I could just see you
 Tonight
 It's always times like these when I think of you
 And I wonder if you ever think of me
 'Cause every thing's so wrong and I don't belong
 Living in your precious memory
 'Cause I need you
 And I miss you
 And now I wonder
 If I could fall into the sky
 Do you think time would pass me by
 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
 If I could just see you
 Tonight
 And I, I
 Don't wanna let you know
 I, I
 Drown in your memory
 I, I
 Don't wanna let this go
 I, I don't
 Making my way downtown, walking fast
 Faces pass and I'm home bound
 Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
 Making a way through the crowd
 And I still need you
 And I still miss you
 And now I wonder
 If I could fall into the sky
 Do you think time would pass us by
 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
 If I could just see you
 If I could fall into the sky
 Do you think time would pass me by
 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
 If I could just see you
 If I could just hold you
 Tonight

__Title__I Bet My Life By Imagine Dragons__Title__

I know I took the path that you would never want for me
 I know I let you down, didn't I
 So many sleepless nights
 Where you were waiting up on me
 Well I'm just a slave unto the night
 Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
 Remember when I broke you down to tears
 I know I took the path that you would never want for me
 I gave you hell through all the years
 So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 I've been around the world but never in my wildest dreams
 Would I come running home to you
 I've told a million lies
 But now I tell a single truth
 There's you in everything I do
 Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
 Remember when I broke you down to tears
 I know I took the path that you would never want for me
 I gave you hell through all the years
 So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 Don't tell me that I'm wrong
 I've walked that road before
 I left you on your own
 And please believe them when they say
 That it's left for yesterday
 And the records that I've played
 Please forgive for all I've done
 So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you
 I, I bet my life, I bet my life
 I bet my life for you

__Title__Last Friday Night (Tgif) By Katy Perry__Title__

There's a stranger in my bed
 There's a pounding in my head
 Glitter all over the room
 Pink flamingos in the pool
 I smell like a minibar
 DJ's passed out in the yard
 Barbies on the barbecue
 Is this a hickey or a bruise
 Pictures of last night
 Ended up online
 I'm screwed
 Oh well
 It's a blacked
 But I'm pretty sure it ruled
 Damn
 Last Friday night
 Yeah we danced on tabletops
 And we took too many shots
 Think we kissed but I forgot
 Last Friday night
 Yeah we maxed our credit cards
 And got kicked out of the bar
 So we hit the boulevard
 Last Friday night
 We went streaking in the park
 Skinny dipping in the dark
 Then had a ménage à trios
 Last Friday night
 Yeah I think we broke the law
 Always say we're gonna stop
 ooh
 This Friday night
 Do it all again
 This Friday night
 Do it all again
 Trying to connect the dots
 Don't know what to tell my boss
 Think the city towed my car
 Chandelier is on the floor
 Ripped my favorite party dress
 Warrants out for my arrest
 Think I need a ginger ale
 That was such an epic fail
 Pictures of last night
 Ended up online
 I'm screwed
 Oh well
 It's a blacked
 But I'm pretty sure it ruled
 Damn
 Last Friday night
 Yeah we danced on tabletops
 And we took too many shots
 Think we kissed but I forgot
 Last Friday night
 Yeah we maxed our credit cards
 And got kicked out of the bar

 Last Friday night
 We went streaking in the park
 Skinny dipping in the dark
 Then had a ménage à trois
 Last Friday night
 Yeah I think we broke the law
 Always say we're gonna stop

__Title__Without You (Feat Usher) By David Guetta__Title__

I can't win, I can't reign
 I will never win this game
 Without you, without you
 I am lost, I am vain
 I will never be the same
 Without you, without you
 I won't run, I won't fly
 I will never make it by
 Without you, without you
 I can't rest, I can't fight
 All I need is you and I
 Without you, without
 Oh oh oh
 You you you
 Without
 You you you
 Without you
 Can't erase, so I'll take blame
 But I can't accept that we're
 Estrange
 Without you, without you
 I can't quit now, this can't be right
 I can't take one more sleep this night
 Without you, without you
 I won't soar, I won't climb
 If you're not here I'm paralyzed without you, without you
 I can't look, I'm so blind
 Lost my heart, I lost my mind without you without
 Oh oh oh
 You you you
 Without
 You you you
 Without you
 I am lost, I am vain
 I will never be the same
 Without you, without you, WITHOUT YOU

 I can't leave you alone
 'Cause you're so disarming
 I'm caught up in the midst of you
 And I cannot resist at all
 Boy, if I do
 The things you want me to
 The way I used to do
 Would you love me, baby
 Or leave me feeling used
 Would you go and break my heart

 But I just keep on coming back incessantly
 Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
 I should have known right from the start
 You'd go and break my heart

 That you know persuade me
 To relinquish my love to you
 But I cannot resist at all
 Boy, if I do
 The things you want me to
 The way I used to do
 Would you love me, baby
 Or leave me feeling used
 Would you go and break my heart

 Okay, cool, aight
 Yo, she wanna shop with Jay, play
 She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
 She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
 She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
 She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
 She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
 She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
 If she find one strand a hair longer than hers
 She want love in the Jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
 Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
 She wanna answer the phone, tatoo her arm
 That's when I gotta send her back to her mom
 She call me, 'Heartbreaker' when we apart
 It makes her wanna piece of paper, scribble down, 
 But she know she love Jay because
 She love everything Jay say, Jay does, and a
 Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
 But I just keep on coming back incessantly
 Oh, why did you have to run your game on me

__Title__U Remind Me By Usher__Title__

Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute
 But I got something to tell ya, listen
 See the thing about you, that caught my eye
 Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind
 Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
 You need to sit down this may take a while
 See this girl she sorta looks just like you
 She even smiles, just the way you do
 So innocent, she seemed but I was schooled
 I'm reminded when I look at you
 But you remind of a girl that I once knew
 See her face whenever I, I look at you
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
 This is why I just can't get it with you
 Thought that she was the one for me
 'Til I found out she was on her dream
 Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me
 This is why we could never be
 You remind of a girl that I once knew
 See her face whenever I, I look at you
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
 This is why I just can't get it with you
 I know it's so unfair to you
 But I'd be lingering the rest to you
 Wish I knew
 Wish I knew how to separate the two
 You remind me, oh
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew
 See her face whenever I, I look at you
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
 This is why I just can't get it with you
 
__Title__Power Over Me By Dermot Kennedy__Title__

We do not have the lyrics for Power Over Me yet
 
__Title__Somebody That I Used To Know By Gotye__Title__

Now and then, I think of when we were together
 Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
 Told myself that you were right for me
 But felt so lonely in your company
 But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember
 You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
 Like resignation to the end, always the end
 So when we found that we could not make sense
 Well, you said that we would still be friends
 But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
 But you didn't have to cut me off
 Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
 And I don't even need your love
 But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
 No, you didn't have to stoop so low
 Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
 I guess that I don't need that though
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
 But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
 But I don't wanna live that way
 Reading into every word you say
 You said that you could let it go
 And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
 But you didn't have to cut me off
 Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
 And I don't even need your love
 But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
 No, you didn't have to stoop so low
 Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
 I guess that I don't need that though
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 Somebody 
 Somebody 
 Somebody 
 Somebody 
 I used to know
 That I used to know
 I used to know
 Somebody
 
__Title__Lush Life By Zara Larsson__Title__

I live my day as if it was the last
 Live my day as if there was no past
 Doin' it all night, all summer
 Doin' it the way I wanna
 Yeah I'm a dance my heart out 'til the dawn
 But I won't be done when morning comes
 Doin' it all night, all summer
 Gonna spend it like no other
 It was a crush
 But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
 It was a rush
 But I gave it up
 It was a crush
 Now I might have went and said too much
 But that's all it was
 So I gave it up
 I live my day as if it was the last
 Live my day as if there was no past
 Doin' it all night, all summer
 Doin' it the way I wanna
 Yeah I'm a dance my heart out 'til the dawn
 But I won't be done when morning comes
 Doin' it all night, all summer
 Gonna spend it like no other
 It was a crush
 I kept saying I'm a stay in touch
 But that thing went bust
 So I gave it up
 No tricks, no bluff
 I'm just better off without them cuffs
 Yeah the sun won't set on us
 Went low, went high
 Still waters run dry
 Gotta get back in the groove
 I ain't ever worry
 Went low, went high
 What matters is now
 Getting right back in the mood
 I live my day as if it was the last
 Live my day as if there was no past
 Doin' it all night, all summer
 Doin' it the way I wanna
 Yeah I'm a dance my heart out 'til the dawn
 But I won't be done when morning comes
 Doin' it all night, all summer
 Gonna spend it like no other
 Now I've found another crush
 The lush life's given me a rush
 Had one chance to make me blush
 Second time is one too late
 Now I've found another crush

She leads a lonely life
 She leads a lonely life
 When she woke up late in the morning light
 And the day had just begun
 She opened up her eyes and thought
 It's not a day for work
 It's a day for catching tan
 Just lying on the beach and having fun
 She's going to get you
 All that she wants is another baby
 She's gone tomorrow, boy
 All that she wants is another baby, yea
 All that she wants is another baby
 She's gone tomorrow, boy
 All that she wants is another baby, yea
 So if you are in sight and the day is right
 She's the hunter you're the fox
 The gentle voice that talks to you
 Won't talk forever
 It is a night for passion
 But the morning means goodbye
 Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
 She's going to get you
 All that she wants is another baby
 She's gone tomorrow, boy
 All that she wants is another baby, yea
 All that she wants is another baby
 She's gone tomorrow, boy
 All that she wants is another baby, yea
 All that she wants is another baby
 She's gone tomorrow, boy
 All that she wants is another baby, yea
 All that she wants is another baby
 She's gone tomorrow, boy
 All that she wants is another baby, yea
 All that she wants

I've been awake for a while now
 You've got me feelin' like a child now
 'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
 I get the tinglees in a silly place
 It starts in my toes
 And I crinkle my nose
 Wherever it goes I always know
 That you make me smile
 Please stay for a while now
 Just take your time
 Wherever you go
 The rain is fallin' on my window pane
 But we are hidin' in a safer place
 Under the covers stayin' safe and warm
 You give me feelings that I adore
 They start in my toes
 Make me crinkle my nose
 Wherever it goes
 I always know
 That you make me smile
 Please stay for a while now
 Just take your time
 Wherever you go
 What am I gonna say
 When you make me feel this way
 I just, mmm
 It starts in my toes
 Makes me crinkle my nose
 Wherever it goes
 I always know
 That you make me smile
 Please stay for a while now
 Just take your time
 Wherever you go
 I've been asleep for a while now
 You tucked me in just like a child now
 'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
 I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
 It starts in my soul
 And I lose all control
 When you kiss my nose
 The feelin' shows
 'Cause you make me smile
 Baby just take your time now
 Holdin' me tight
 Wherever, wherever, where ever you go
 Wherever, wherever, where ever you go
 
__Title__F**Kin' Perfect By P!Nk__Title__

Made a wrong turn, once or twice
 Dug my way out, blood and fire
 Bad decisions, that's alright
 Welcome to my silly life
 Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
 Miss 'No way, it's all good', it didn't slow me down
 Mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated
 Look, I'm still around
 Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
 Like you're less than less than fucking perfect
 Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
 You're fucking perfect to me!
 You're so mean, when you talk about yourself, you were wrong
 Change the voices in your head, make them like you instead
 So complicated, look happy, you'll make it!
 Filled with so much hatred
 It's enough! I've done all I can think of
 Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same
 Oh, pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
 Like you're less than less than fucking perfect
 Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
 You're fucking perfect to me
 The whole world's scared so I swallow the fear
 The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
 So cool in line, and we try try try
 But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time
 Done looking for the critics, cause they're everywhere
 They dont like my jeans, they don't get my hair
 Exchange ourselves, and we do it all the time
 Why do we do that
 Why do I do that
 Yeah, oh, oh, pretty please!
 Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
 Like you're less than less than fucking perfect
 Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel
 Like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me
 You're perfect, you're perfect!
 Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
 You're fucking perfect to me
 
__Title__Stay With Me By Sam Smith__Title__

Guess it's true
 I'm not good at a one night stand
 But I still need love 'cause I'm just man
 These nights never seem to go to plan
 I don't want you to leave
 Will you hold my hand
 Oh, won't you stay with me
 'Cause you're all I need
 This ain't love, it's clear to see
 But darling, stay with me
 Why am I so emotional
 No it's not a good look, gain some self control
 Deep down I know this never works
 But you could lay with me
 So it doesn't hurt
 Oh, won't you stay with me
 'Cause you're all I need
 This ain't love, it's clear to see
 But darling, stay with me
 Oooh oh ooh oooh ooooh oh
 Oooh oh ooh oooh ooooh oh
 Oh, won't you stay with me
 'Cause you're all I need
 This ain't love, it's clear to see
 But darling, stay with me
 Oh, wont you stay with me
 Cause you're all I need
 This ain't love its clear to see
 But darling
 Stay with me
 
__Title__Waterfalls By Tlc__Title__

A lonely mother gazing out of her window
 Staring at a son that she just can't touch
 If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
 But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
 But all the praying just ain't helping at all
 'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
 So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
 Another body laying cold in the gutter
 Listen to me
 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
 But I think you're moving too fast
 Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
 But he just can't see
 She give him loving that his body can't handle
 But all he can say is, 
 One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
 But he doesn't recognize his own face
 His health is fading and he doesn't know why
 Three letters took him to his final resting place
 Y'all don't hear me
 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
 But I think you're moving too fast
 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
 But I think you're moving too fast
 I seen rainbow yesterday
 But too many storms have come and gone
 Leavin' a trace of not on God
 Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
 I pray all ten fade away
 Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
 And like his promise is true
 Only my faith can undo
 The many chances I blew
 To bring my life to anew
 Clear blue and unconditional skies
 Have dried the tears from my eyes
 No more lonely cries
 My only bleedin' hope
 Is for the folk who can't cope
 Wit such an endurin' pain
 That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
 Who's to blame
 For tootin' caine in your own vein
 What a shame
 You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
 You claim the insane
 And name this day in time
 For fallin prey to crime
 I say the system got you victim to your own mind
 Dreams are hopeless aspirations
 In hopes of comin' true
 Believe in yourself
 The rest is up to me and you
 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
 But I think you're moving too fast
 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
 But I think you're moving too fast

 Observing the crookedness as it mingled with the good people we meet
 Good friends we had
 Good friends we've lost along the way

 For pain of losing family, but while I'm gone Shorty
