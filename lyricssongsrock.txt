__Title__What I'Ve Done By Linkin Park__Title__

In this farewell
 There's no blood
 There's no alibi
 Cause I've drawn regret
 From the truth
 Of a thousand lies
 So let mercy come
 And wash away
 What I've done
 I'll face myself
 To cross out what I've become
 Erase myself
 And let go of what I've done
 Put to rest
 What you thought of me
 While I clean this slate
 With the hands
 Of uncertainty
 So let mercy come
 And wash away
 What I've done
 I'll face myself
 To cross out what I've become
 Erase myself
 And let go of what I've done
 For what I've done
 I start again
 And whatever pain may come
 Today this ends
 I'm forgiving what I've done
 I'll face myself
 To cross out what I've become
 Erase myself
 And let go of what I've done
 What I've done
   
   
 Forgiving what I've done

Can't stop addicted to the shindig
 Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
 Choose not a life of imitation
 Distant cousin to the reservation
 Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
 This punk the feeling that you stay for
 In time I want to be your best friend
 Eastside love is living on the Westend
 Knock out but boy you better come to
 Don't die you know the truth is some do
 Go write your message on the pavement
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
 White heat is screaming in the jungle
 Complete the motion if you stumble
 Go ask the dust for any answers
 Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
 The world I love
 The tears I drop
 To be part of
 The wave can't stop
 Ever wonder if it's all for you
 The world I love
 The trains I hop
 To be part of
 The wave can't stop
 Come and tell me when it's time to
 Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
 So smart she's leading me to ozone
 Music the great communicator
 Use two sticks to make it in the nature
 I'll get you into penetration
 The gender of a generation
 The birth of every other nation
 Worth your weight the gold of meditation
 This chapter's going to be a close one
 Smoke rings I know your going to blow one
 All on a spaceship persevering
 Use my hands for everything but steering
 Can't stop the spirits when they need you
 Moptops are happy when they feed you
 J
 Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
 The world I love
 The tears I drop
 To be part of
 The wave can't stop
 Ever wonder if it's all for you
 The world I love
 The trains I hop
 To be part of
 The wave can't stop
 Come and tell me when it's time to
 Wait a minute I'm passing out
 Win or lose just like you
 Far more shocking
 Than anything I ever knew
 How about you
 Ten more reasons
 Why I need somebody new just like you
 Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
 Right on cue
 Can't stop addicted to the shindig
 Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
 Choose not a life of imitation
 Distant cousin to the reservation
 Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
 This punk the feeling that you stay for
 In time I want to be your best friend
 Eastside love is living on the Westend
 Knock out but boy you better come to
 Don't die you know the truth is some do
 Go write your message on the pavement
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
 Kick start the golden generator
 Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
 Can't stop the gods from engineering
 Feel no need for any interfering
 Your image in the dictionary
 This life is more than ordinary
 Can I get two maybe even three of these
 Coming from space
 To teach you of the Pleides
 Can't stop the spirits when they need you
 This life is more than just a read through
 
__Title__Boulevard Of Broken Dreams By Green Day__Title__

I walk a lonely road
 The only one that I have ever known
 Don't know where it goes
 But it's home to me, and I walk alone
 I walk this empty street
 On the boulevard of broken dreams
 Where the city sleeps
 And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk a
 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 'Til then I walk alone
 I'm walking down the line
 That divides me somewhere in my mind
 On the border line
 Of the edge and where I walk alone
 Read between the lines
 Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
 And I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk a
 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 'Til then I walk alone
 I walk alone, I walk a
 I walk this empty street
 On the boulevard of broken dreams
 Where the city sleeps
 And I'm the only one and I walk a
 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
 'Til then I walk alone

It's bugging me, grating me
 And twisting me around
 Yeah, I'm endlessly caving in
 And turning inside out
 'Cause I want it now, I want it now
 Give me your heart and your soul
 And I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
 Last chance to lose control
 It's holding me, morphing me
 And forcing me to strive
 To be endlessly cold within
 And dreaming I'm alive
 'Cause I want it now, I want it now
 Give me your heart and your soul
 I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
 Last chance to lose control
 And I want you now, I want you now
 I'll feel my heart implode
 And I'm breaking out, escaping now
 Feeling my faith erode

I'm gonna fight 'em off
 A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
 They're gonna rip it off
 Taking their time right behind my back
 And I'm talking to myself at night
 Because I can't forget
 Back and forth through my mind
 Behind a cigarette
 And the message coming from my eyes
 Says leave it alone
 Don't want to hear about it
 Every single one's got a story to tell
 Everyone knows about it
 From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
 And if I catch it coming back my way
 I'm gonna serve it to you
 And that ain't what you want to hear
 But that's what I'll do
 And the feeling coming from my bones
 Says find a home
 I'm going to Wichita
 Far from this opera for evermore
 I'm gonna work the straw
 Make the sweat drip out of every pore
 And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
 Right before the Lord
 All the words are gonna bleed from me
 And I will think no more

 I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
 I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
 And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah
 I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
 After all I knew it had to be something to do with you

 If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand
 I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

 You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep
 You took for granted all the times I never let you down
 You stumbled in and bumped your head, if not for me then you'd be dead

 She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
 It's a matter of time before we all run out
 When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
 I waited eight long months
 She finally set him free
 I told him I can't lie he was the only one for me
 Two weeks and we had caught on fire
 She's got it out for me
 But I wear the biggest smile
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But, I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But god does it feel so good
 Cause I got him where I want him right now
 And if you could then you know you would
 Cause god it just feels so
 It just feels so good
 Second chances they don't ever matter, people never change
 Once a whore you're nothing more,
 i'm sorry, that'll never change
 And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
 I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way
 Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
 Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
 They want and what they want it's easy if you do it right
 Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
 Whoa, I never meant to brag
 But, I got him where I want him now
 Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
 To steal it all away from you now
 But god does it feel so good

 And if you could then you know you would
 Cause god it just feels so

 Cut my life into pieces
 I've reached my last resort
 Suffocation, no breathing

 Would it be wrong or
 Would it be right
 If I took my life tonight
 Chances are that I might
 Mutilation out of sight
 And I'm contemplating suicide
 'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 I never realized, I was spread too thin
 Till it was too late and I was empty within
 Hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin
 Downward spiral, where do I begin
 It all started when I lost my mother
 No love for myself and no love for another
 Searching to find a love upon a higher level
 Finding nothing but questions and devils
 'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
 I'm running and I'm crying
 I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying I'm crying
 I can't go on living this way
 Cut my life into pieces
 This is my last resort
 Suffocation, no, no breathing
 Don't give a fuck
 If I cut my arm bleeding
 Would it be wrong
 Would it be right
 If I took my life tonight
 Chances are that I might
 Mutilation out of sight
 And I'm contemplating suicide
 'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
 Losing my sight, losing my mind
 Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

 Can't go on, living this way

__Title__In The End By Linkin Park__Title__

It starts with
 One thing I don't know why
 It doesn't even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 All I know
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 It's so unreal
 Didn't look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
 Or wasted it all just to watch you go
 I kept everything inside
 And even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be
 A memory of a time when
 I tried so hard and got so far
 But in the end it doesn't even matter
 I had to fall to lose it all
 But in the end it doesn't even matter
 One thing, I don't know why
 It doesn't even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
 To remind myself how
 I tried so hard
 In spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like I was part of your property
 Remembering all the times you fought with me
 I'm surprised
 It got so far
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
 Not that you knew me back then
 But it all comes back to me in the end
 You kept everything inside
 And even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be
 A memory of a time when
 I tried so hard and got so far
 But in the end it doesn't even matter
 I had to fall to lose it all
 But in the end it doesn't even matter
 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as I can go
 And for all this
 There's only one thing you should know
 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as I can go
 And for all this
 There's only one thing you should know
 I tried so hard and got so far
 But in the end it doesn't even matter
 I had to fall to lose it all
 But in the end it doesn't even matter
 
__Title__I Miss You By Blink 182__Title__

I miss you
 Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
 The shadow in the background of the morgue
 The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
 We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
 Where you can always find me
 And we'll have halloween on Christmas
 And in the night we'll wish this never ends
 We'll wish this never ends
 I miss you, miss you
 I miss you, miss you
 Where are you and I'm so sorry
 I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
 I need somebody and always
 This sick, strange darkness
 Comes creeping on so haunting everytime
 And as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders
 Catching things and eating their insides
 Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason
 Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
 Stop this pain tonight
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head
 Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head

They're gonna clean up your looks
 With all the lies in the books
 To make a citizen out of you
 Because they sleep with a gun
 And keep an eye on you, son
 So they can watch all the things you do
 Because the drugs never work
 They're gonna give you a smirk
 'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
 They're gonna rip up your heads
 Your aspirations to shreds
 Another cog in the murder machine
 They said all
 Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
 They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
 So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
 The boys and girls in the clique
 The awful names that they stick
 You're never gonna fit in much, kid
 But if you're troubled and hurt
 What you got under your shirt
 We'll make them pay for the things that they did
 They said all
 Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
 They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
 So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
 They said all

 All together now!
 Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
 They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
 So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
 Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
 Teenagers scare the living shit out of me

__Title__Californication By Red Hot Chili Peppers__Title__

Psychic spies from China
 Try to steal your mind's elation
 And little girls from Sweden
 Dream of silver screen quotations
 And if you want these kind of dreams
 It's Californication
 It's the edge of the world
 And all of Western civilization
 The sun may rise in the east
 At least it settled in a final location
 It's understood that Hollywood
 Sells Californication
 Pay your surgeon very well
 To break the spell of aging
 Celebrity skin is this your chin
 Or is that war you're waging
 First born unicorn
 Hard core soft porn
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
 Be my very own constellation
 A teenage bride with a baby inside
 Getting high on information
 And buy me a star on the boulevard
 It's Californication
 Space may be the final frontier
 But it's made in a Hollywood basement
 And Cobain can you hear the spheres
 Singing songs off station to station
 And Alderaan's not far away
 It's Californication
 Born and raised by those who praise
 Control of population
 Everybody's been there
 And I don't mean on vacation
 First born unicorn
 Hard core soft porn
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication
 Destruction leads to a very rough road
 But it also breeds creation
 And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
 They're just another good vibration
 And tidal waves couldn't save the world
 From Californication
 Pay your surgeon very well
 To break the spell of aging
 Sicker then the rest there is no test
 But this is what you're craving
 First born unicorn
 Hard core soft porn
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Cailfornication
 Dream of Californication
 Dream of Californication

Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
 And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
 Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
 And as you step back in the line a mob jumps to their feet
 Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
 And no one even knew, it was really only you
 And now you steal away
 Take him out today
 Nice work you did
 You're gonna go far, kid
 With a thousand lies and a good disguise
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives
 Slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sights
 So play it out I'm wide awake, it's a scene about me
 There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
 And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me
 Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
 And no one even knew, it was really only you
 And now you'll lead the way
 Show the light of day
 Nice work you did
 You're gonna go far, kid
 Trust, deceived
 With a thousand lies and a good disguise
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives
 Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
 And no one even knew, it was really only you
 So dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
 It was really only you
 With a thousand lies and a good disguise
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives
 Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
 Hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes
 When you walk away, nothing more to say
 See the lightning in your eyes, see em running for their lives

 More wood for the fires, loud neighbours
 Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

 Laugh it all off in your face
 What would you do
 What if I fell to the floor
 Couldn't take all this anymore
 What would you do, do, do
 Come, break me down
 Bury me, bury me

 Beg for the rest of my life
 What would you do
 You say you wanted more
 What are you waiting for
 I'm not running from you
 Come, break me down
 Bury me, bury me
 I am finished with you
 Look in my eyes
 You're killing me, killing me
 All I wanted was you
 I tried to be someone else
 But nothing seemed to change
 I know now, this is who I really am inside
 Finally found myself
 Fighting for a chance
 I know now, this is who I really am
 Come, break me down
 Bury me, bury me
 I am finished with you, you, you
 Look in my eyes
 You're killing me, killing me

 Barely stuttered out 
 Stuck to my tongue
 Weighed down with words too

 And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
 These words are all I have so I'll write them

 We're falling apart to half time
 Dance, dance
 And these are the lives you love to lead
 Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
 How misery loved me
 You always fold just
 Before you're found out
 Drink up, it's last call, last resort
 But only the first mistake and
 I'm two quarters and a heart down
 And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
 These words are all I have so I'll write them

 Why don't you show me the little bit of spine

 Crawling into bed with me

__Title__Take A Look Around By Limp Bizkit__Title__

All attention in the world today
 All the little girls fillin' up the world today
 When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
 But I'ma live my life like I should
 Now all the critics wanna hit it
 Shit can, now we did it
 Just because they don't get it
 But I'll stay fitted
 New era committed
 Now this red cap
 Gets a rap from his critics
 Do we always gotta cry
 Do we always gotta be inside a lie
 Life is just a blast movin' very fast
   
 Better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
 Follow me into a solo
 Remember that, kid
 So what you wanna do
 And where you gonna run
 When you starin' down a cable
 Of a mic pointed, that you grill like a gun
 Limp Bizkit is rocking the set
 It's like Russian roulette
 When you're placin' your bet
 So don't be upset
 When you're broke
 And you're done
 'Cause I'ma be the one
 Till I jet
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
   
 'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
 Why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 And now you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Does anybody really know the secret
 Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
 It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
 But everything happens for a reason
 I don't even know what I should say
 'Cause I'm an idiot a loser, microphone abuser
 I analyze every second I exist
 Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist
 And everybody wanna run
   
 Everybody wanna hide from the gun
 You can take that ride through this life if you want
 But you can't take that edge off that knife
 And now you want your money back
   
 But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sac
 And there ain't nothing I can do
 'Cause life is a lesson, you'll learn it when you're through
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 I know why you wanna hate me
   
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Why you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Now you wanna hate me
 'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
 Now I know why
 Now I know why
 Now I know why
 Now I know why you wanna hate me
 Now I know why you wanna hate me

How can you see into my eyes like open doors
 Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
 Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
 Until you find it there and lead it back home
 Wake me up inside 
 Wake me up inside 
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run 
 Before I come undone 
 Save me from the nothing I've become
 Now that I know what I'm without
 You can't just leave me
 Breathe into me and make me real
 Bring me to life
 Wake me up inside 
 Wake me up inside 
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run 
 Before I come undone 
 Save me from the nothing I've become
 Bring me to life
 Bring me to life
 Frozen inside without your touch, without your love
 Darling, only you are the life among the dead
 All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
 Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
 I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
 Got to open my eyes to everything
 Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
 Don't let me die here 
 Bring me to life
 Wake me up inside 
 Wake me up inside 
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run 
 Before I come undone 
 Save me from the nothing I've become
 Bring me to life
 Bring me to life

It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten
 What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
 As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is dropping
 Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten
 There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
 And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
 But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
 Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear
 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out
 'Cause I don't know
 That's when she said I don't hate you boy
 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
 That's when I told her I love you girl
 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh
 And the day pressed on like crushing weights
 For no man does it ever wait
 Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
 Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
 Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand
 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out
 'Cause I don't know
 That's when she said I don't hate you boy
 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
 That's when I told her I love you girl
 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh
 One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
 But so much left that I don't know
 We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
 It takes me under, it takes me under once again
 I don't hate you
 I don't hate you, no
 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out
 'Cause I don't know
 That's when she said I don't hate you boy
 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
 That's when I told her I love you girl
 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh
 I don't hate you
 I don't hate you, oh, oh
 I don't hate you
 I don't hate you, no, oh, oh

 I'm your fool
 Everyone's got their chains to break
 Holdin' you
 Were you born to resist, or be abused
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Or are you gone and onto someone new
 I needed somewhere to hang my head
 Without your noose
 You gave me something that I didn't have
 But had no use
 I was too weak to give in
 Too strong to lose
 My heart is under arrest again
 But I'll break loose
 My head is giving me life or death
 But I can't choose
 I swear I'll never give in
 I refuse
 Is someone getting the best

 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Has someone taken your faith
 It's real, the pain you feel
 You trust, you must confess
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Has someone taken your faith
 It's real, the pain you feel
 The life, the love
 You'd die to heal
 The hope that starts
 The broken hearts
 You trust, you must confess
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 I've got another confession my friend
 I'm no fool
 I'm getting tired of starting again
 Somewhere new
 Were you born to resist, or be abused
 I swear I'll never give in, I refuse
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Is someone getting the best
 The best, the best, the best of you
 Has someone taken your faith
 It's real, the pain you feel

 And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
 So now I'll ask, do you like that
 No!
 Something's getting in the way
 Something's just about to break
 I will try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 So tell me how it should be!
 Try to find out what makes you tick
 As I lie down, sore and sick
 Do you like that
 There's a fine line between love and hate
 And I don't mind, just let me say
 That I like that, I like that
 Something's getting in the way
 Something's just about to break
 I will try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 As I burn another page
 As I look the other way
 I still try to find my place
 In the diary of Jane
 So tell me how it should be!
 Desperate, I will crawl, waiting for so long
 No love, there is no love
 Die for anyone, what have I become
 Something's getting in the way
 Something's just about to break
 I will try to find my place

 As I burn another page
 As I look the other way

__Title__Welcome To The Black Parade By My Chemical Romance__Title__

When I was a young boy
 My father took me into the city
 To see a marching band
 He said, 
 would you be the saviour of the broken
 the beaten and the damned
 He said 
 your demons, and all the non
 the plans that they have made
 A phantom to lead you in the summer
 To join The Black Parade
 When I was a young boy my father took me into the city
 to see a marching band
 you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten, and the damned
 Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
 And other times I feel like I should go
 When through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
 And when you're gone we want you all to know
 We'll carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're dead and gone believe me
 Your memory will carry on
 We'll carry on
 And in my heart I can't contain it
 The anthem won't explain it
 A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
 Your misery and hate will kill us all
 So paint it black and take it back
 Let's shout it loud and clear
 Defiant to the end we hear the call
 To carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're dead and gone believe me
 Your memory will carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're broken and defeated
 Your weary widow marches
 On and on we carry through the fears
 Ooh oh ohhhh
 Disappointed faces of your peers
 Ooh oh ohhhh
 Take a look at me cause I could not care at all
 Do or die, you'll never make me
 Because the world will never take my heart
 Go and try, you'll never break me
 We want it all, we wanna play this part
 I won't explain or say I'm sorry
 I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
 Give a cheer for all the broken
 Listen here, because it's who we are
 I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
 Just a boy, who had to sing this song
 I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
 I! don't! care!
 We'll carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're dead and gone believe me
 Your memory will carry on
 We'll carry on
 And though you're broken and defeated
 Your weary widow marches on
 Do or die, you'll never make me
 Because the world will never take my heart
 Go and try, you'll never break me
 We want it all, we wanna play this part 
 Do or die, you'll never make me 
 Because the world will never take my heart 
 Go and try, you'll never break me 
 We want it all, we wanna play this part

 Every time we lie awake
 After every hit we take
 Every feeling that I get
 But I haven't missed you yet
 Only when I stop to think about it
 I hate everything about you
 Why do I love you
 I hate everything about you
 Why do I love you
 Only when I stop to think about you
 I know
 Only when you stop to think about me
 Do you know
 I hate everything about you
 Why do I love you
 You hate everything about me
 Why do you love me
 I hate
 You hate
 I hate you
 Love me!
 I hate everything about you
 Why do I love you

Lay where you're laying
 Don't make a sound
 I know they're watching
 They're watching
 All the commotion
 The kiddie like play
 Has people talking
 They're talking
 You, Your sex is on fire
 Dark of the alley
 The breaking of day
 Head while I'm driving
 I'm driving
 Soft lips are open
 Them knuckles are pale
 Feels like you're dying
 You're dying
 You, Your sex is on fire
 Consumed,
 With the what's to transpire
 Hot as a fever
 Rattling bones
 I could just taste it
 Taste it
 But it's not forever
 But it's just tonight
 Oh we're still the greatest
 The greatest
 The greatest
 You, Your sex is on fire
 You, Your sex is on fire
 Consumed,
 With the what's to transpire
 And you
 Your sex is on fire
 Consumed,
 With the what's to transpire
 
__Title__I'M Not Okay (I Promise) By My Chemical Romance__Title__

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
 I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way
 For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
 Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 You wear me out
 What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
 I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
 To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
 I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 You wear me out
 Forget about the dirty looks
 The photographs your boyfriend took
 You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed
 I'm okay
 I'm okay!
 I'm okay, now
 But you really need to listen to me
 Because I'm telling you the truth
 I mean this, I'm okay!
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay
 Well, I'm not okay
 I'm not o
 I'm not okay
 I'm not okay

You sit there in your
 Heartache
 Waiting on some beautiful boy to
 To save your from your old ways
 You play forgiveness
 Watch it now
 Here he comes
 He doesn't look a thing like
 Jesus
 But he
 Talks like a gentlemen
 Like you imagined when you
 Were young
 Can we climb this mountain
 I don't know
 Higher now than ever before, I
 Know we can make it if we take it slow
 Let's take it easy
 Easy now
 Watch it go
 We're burning down the highway skyline
 On the
 Back of a hurricane
 That started turning
 When you
 Were young
 When you
 Were young
 And sometimes you close your eyes
 And see the place where you used to live
 When you
 Were young
 They say the devil's water
 It ain't so sweet
 You don't have to drink right now
 But you can dip your feet
 Every once in a
 Little while
 You sit there in your
 Heartache
 Waiting on some beautiful boy to
 To save you from your old ways
 You play forgiveness
 Watch it now
 Here he comes
 He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
 But he
 Talks like a gentlemen
 Like you imagined when you
 Were young 
 When you
 Were young
 I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus
 He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
 But more than you'll ever know

 They need you buried deep
 The secrets that you keep are ever ready

 Done pleading ignorance

And it's been awhile, since I could hold my head up high
 And it's been awhile, since I first saw you
 And it's been awhile, since I could stand on my own two feet again
 And it's been awhile, since I could call you
 And everything I can't remember
 As fucked up as it all may seem
 The consequences that I've rendered
 I stretched myself beyond my means
 And it's been awhile, since I can say that I wasn't addicted
 And it's been awhile, since I can say I love myself as well
 And it's been awhile, since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
 And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you
 And everything I can't remember
 As fucked up as it all may seem
 The consequences that I've rendered
 I've gone and fucked things up again
 Why must I feel this way
 Just make this go away
 Just one more peaceful day
 And it's been awhile, since I could look at myself straight
 And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry
 And it's been awhile, since I've seen the way the candles light your face
 And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste
 And everything I can't remember
 As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me
 I cannot blame this on my father
 He did the best he could for me
 And it's been awhile, since I could hold my head up high
 And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry

Hey girl, you know, you drive me crazy
 One look puts the rhythm in my hand
 Still I'll never understand why you hang around
 I see what's goin' down
 Cover up with make up in the mirror
 Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again
 You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
 Do you feel like a man, when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
 A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
 Every action in this world will bear a consequence
 If you wade around forever you will surely drown
 I see what's going down
 I see the way you go and say you're right again
 Say you're right again, heed my lecture
 Do you feel like a man, when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
 Face down in the dirt she said
 She said
 Face down in the dirt she said
 She said
 One day she will tell you that she has had enough
 It's coming round again
 Do you feel like a man, when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
 Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
 As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
 Do you feel like a man, when you push her around
 Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground

__Title__She Hates Me By Puddle Of Mudd__Title__

Met a girl, thought she was grand
 Fell in love found out first hand
 Went well for a week or two
 Then it all came unglued
 In a trap, trip I can't grip
 Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
 Then I started to realize
 I was livin' one big lie
 She fuckin' hates me
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 La la la love
 I tried too hard and she tore my feelings
 Like I had none and ripped them away
 She was queen for about an hour
 After that, shit got sour
 She took all I ever had
 No sign of guilt, no feelin' bad no
 In a trap, trip I can't grip
 Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
 Then I started to realize
 I was livin' one big lie
 She fuckin' hates me
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 La la la love
 I tried too hard and she tore my feelings
 Like I had none and ripped them away
 That's my story, as you see
 Learned my lesson and so did she
 Now it's over and I'm glad
 'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said
 She fuckin' hates me
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me
 La la la love
 I tried too hard and she tore my feelings
 Like I had none and ripped them away
 Trust
 Trust
 And she tore my feelings like I had none
 Trust, she fuckin' hates me

 It's a new day
 But it all feels old
 It's a good life
 That's what I'm told
 But every day, it all just feels the same
 And my high school
 It felt more to me
 Like a jail cell
 A penitentiary
 My time spent there it only made me see
 That I don't ever wanna be like you
 I don't wanna do the things you do
 I'm never gonna hear the words you say
 And I don't ever wanna
 I don't ever wanna be
 You, don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm sayin' is, this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 You, don't wanna be you
 Go to college
 A university
 Get a real job
 That's what they said to me
 But I could never, live the way they want
 I'm gonna get by
 And just do my time
 Out of step while
 They all get in line
 I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
 Do you really wanna to be like them
 Do you really wanna be another trend
 Do you wanna be part of that crowd
 'Cause I don't ever wanna
 I don't ever wanna be, you
 Don't wanna be just like you
 What I'm saying is, this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 You, don't wanna be you
 Shake it once that's fine
 Shake it twice that's okay
 Shake it three times
 Your playin' with your self again
 What I'm saying is, this is the anthem
 Throw all your hands up
 Now you can feel me
 Sing if you're with me
 You, don't wanna be just like you

 Throw all your hands up

 Hey, don't let it go to waste, 
 I love it, but I hate the taste,

 Done, done, on to the next one, 
 Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next
