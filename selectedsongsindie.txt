__Title__Oblivion By Grimes__Title__

I never walk about after dark
 It's my point of view
 'Cause someone could break your neck
 Coming up behind you
 Always coming and you'd never have a clue
 I never look behind all the time
 I will wait forever
 Always looking straight
 Thinking counting all the hours you wait
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 And no, I'm not a jerk
 I would ask if you could help me out
 It's hard to understand
 'Cause when you're running by yourself
 It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
 You know it's good to be tough like me
 But I will wait forever
 I need someone else
 To look into my eyes and tell me
 To look into my eyes and tell me
 Lalalalala
 To look into my eyes and tell me
 Lalalalala
 Lalalalala
 Lalalalala
 Lalalalala
 Lalalalala
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 See you on a dark night
 
__Title__Dreams Tonite By Alvvays__Title__

Rode here on the bus
 Now you're one of us
 It was magic hour
 Counting motorbikes on the turnpike
 One of Eisenhower's
 Live your life on a merry
 Who starts a fire just to let it go out
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 On the lead guitar
 Said you'd go to work
 In the waking hour
 In fluorescent light
 Antisocialites watch a wilting flower
 Live your life on a merry
 Who builds a wall just to let it fall down
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 Don't sit by the phone for me
 Wait at home for me, all alone for me
 Your face was supposed to be hanging over me like a rosary
 So morose for me
 Is it so naive to wonder
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight
 
__Title__Motion Sickness By Phoebe Bridgers__Title__

I hate you for what you did
 And I miss you like a little kid
 I faked it every time but that's alright
 I can hardly feel anything
 I hardly feel anything at all
 You gave me fifteen hundred
 To see your hypnotherapist
 I only went one time
 You let it slide
 Fell on hard times a year ago
 Was hoping you would let it go and you did
 I have emotional motion sickness
 Somebody roll the windows down
 There are no words in the English language
 I could scream to drown you out
 I'm on the outside looking through
 You're throwing rocks around your room
 And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
 I'll be glad that I made it out
 And sorry that it all went down like it did
 I have emotional motion sickness
 Somebody roll the windows down
 There are no words in the English language
 I could scream to drown you out
 And why do you sing with an English accent
 I guess it's too late to change it now
 You know I'm never gonna let you have it
 But I will try to drown you out
 You said when you met me you were bored
 You said when you met me you were bored
 And you you were in a band when I was born
 I have emotional motion sickness
 I try to stay clean and live without
 And I want to know what would happen
 If I surrender to the sound
 Surrender to the sound

__Title__Avant Gardener By Courtney Barnett__Title__

I sleep in late
 Another day
 Oh what a wonder
 Oh what a waste
 It's a monday
 It's so mundane
 What exciting things
 Will happen today
 The yard is full of hard rubbish it's a mess and
 I guess the neighbours must think we run a meth lab
 We should ammend that
 I pull the sheets back
 It's 40 degrees
 And i feel like i'm dying
 Life's getting hard in here
 So i do some gardening
 Anything to take my mind away from where it's sposed to be
 The nice lady next door talks of green beds
 And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
 I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps
 Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes
 I feel pro
 I pull out weeds
 All of a sudden
 I'm having trouble breathing in
 My hands are shaky
 My knees are weak
 I can't seem to stand
 On my own two feet
 I'm breathing but i'm wheezing
 Feel like i'm emphysem
 My throat feels like a funnel
 Filled with weetabix and kerosene and
 Oh no, next thing i know
 They call up triple o
 I'd rather die than owe the hospital
 Till I get old
 I get adrenalin
 Straight to the heart
 I feel like Uma Thurman
 Post
 Reminds me of the time
 When i was really sick and i
 Had too much psuedoefedryn and i
 Couldn't sleep at night
 Halfway down high street, andy looks ambivalent
 He's probably wondering what i'm doing getting in an ambulance
 The paramedic thinks i'm clever cos i play guitar
 I think she's clever cos she stops people dying
 Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic
 Should've stayed in bed today
 I much prefer the mundane
 I take a hit from
 An asthma puffer
 I do it wrong
 I was never good at smoking bongs
 I'm not that good at breathing in
 
__Title__Brazil By Declan Mckenna__Title__

I heard you sold the Amazon
 To show the country that you're from
 Is where the world should want to be
 For a fine something all people need
 I'm faithless now
 Though we win every time and I don't know how
 'Cause I haven't bought you and I haven't sold me
 But the people are dying to get on TV
 I heard he lives down a river somewhere
 With six cars and a grizzly bear
 He's got eyes, but he can't see
 Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
 Oh, Lord!
 What have I become
 I'm the face of God, I'm my father's son
 I'm not what you think you see
 I know you can't eat leather, but you can't stop me
 Why would you lie, why would you lie about how you feel
 I've got a mission and my mission is real
 Because you've had your chances, yeah you've had enough
 I'm gonna burn your house down to spread peace and love
 And it gets me down
 Oh, Lord, how it gets me down
 I heard he lives down a river somewhere
 With six cars and a grizzly bear
 He's got eyes, but he can't see
 Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
 Oh, Lord!
 I wanna play the beautiful game while I'm in Brazil
 'Cause everybody plays the beautiful game out in Brazil
 And it's all you've ever wanted, and it's all that you want still
 Don't you wanna play the beautiful game out in Brazil
 I wanna play the beautiful game while I'm in Brazil
 'Cause everybody plays the beautiful game out in Brazil
 And it's all you've ever wanted, and it's all that you want still
 Don't you wanna play the beautiful game out in Brazil
 I heard he lives down a river somewhere
 With six cars and a grizzly bear
 He's got eyes, but he can't see
 Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
 I heard he lives down a river somewhere
 With six cars and a grizzly bear
 He's got eyes, but he can't see
 Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
 
__Title__Archie, Marry Me By Alvvays__Title__

You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony
 You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony
 We spend our days locked in a room content inside a bubble
 And in the nighttime we go out and scour the streets for trouble
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 During the summer take me sailing out on the Atlantic
 I won't set my sights on other seas there is no need to panic
 So honey take me by the hand and we can sign some papers
 Forget the invitations, floral arrangements and bread makers
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 Too late to go out and
 Too young to stay in
 They're talking about
 Us living in sin
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 Hey hey
 Marry me Archie
 Hey hey

__Title__Seasons (Waiting On You) By Future Islands__Title__

Seasons change, and I tried hard just to soften you
 The seasons change, but I've grown tired of tryin' to change for you
 Because I've been waiting on you
 I've been waiting on you
 Because I've been waiting on you
 I've been waiting on you
 As it breaks, the summer awaits
 But the winter washed whats left of the taste
 As it breaks, the summer awaits
 But the winter craved whats lost
 Crave whats all
 People change, even though some people never do
 You know when people change
 They gain a piece but they lose one too
 Because I've been hanging on you
 I've been waiting on you
 Because I've been waiting on you
 I've been hanging on you
 As it breaks, the summer awaits
 But the winter washed whats left of the taste
 As it breaks, the summer awaits
 But the winter craved whats lost
 Crave whats all

Time's gone inside out
 Time gets distorted with
 This intense gravity
 I don't got time for holy rollers
 Though they may wash my feet
 And I won't be their soldier
 There's intense gravity in you
 I'm just your satellite
 Ooh, and I know that time's gone inside out
 And now it's only like I told you
 Mmm, though they may wash my feet
 They do not make me complete
 Break out of character for me
 Time keeps on going when
 We got nothing else to give
 We got nothing else to give
 Ooh, cause our time's gone inside out
 I don't make time for holy rollers
 Mmm, there's only you I need
 They do not make me complete
 
__Title__Feels Like We Only Go Backwards By Tame Impala__Title__

It feels like I only go backwards baby
 Every part of me says 
 But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
 Feels like we only go backwards darling
 I know that you think you sound
 silly when you call my name
 But I hear it inside my head all day
 When I realise I'm just holding onto
 the hope that maybe
 your feelings don't show
 It feels like I only go backwards baby
 Every part of me says go ahead
 Then I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
 Feels like we only go backwards darling
 The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
 'Cause I decided long ago
 But that's the way it seems to go when trying
 so hard to get to something real
 It feels
 It feels like I only go backwards, darling
 Every part of me says go ahead
 I got my hopes up again, no no, not again
 Feels like we only go backwards darling
 It feels like I only go backwards, baby
 Every part of me says go ahead
 I got my hopes up again, no no, not again
 Feels like we only go backwards darling
 It feels like I only go backwards, baby
 Every part of me says go ahead
 I got my hopes up again, no no, not again
 Feels like we only go backwards darling

Shake your hair
 Have some fun
 Forget our mothers
 and past lovers
 forget everyone
 Oh I'm so lucky
 You are my best friend
 Oh there's no one, there's no one knows me like you do
 Are your lights on
 Are your lights still on
 I'll keep you safe
 You keep me strong
 Remember when we cut our hair
 We both looked like boys
 But we didn't care
 Stick it out together like we always do
 Oh there's no one, there's no one quite like you
 Are your lights on
 Are your lights still on
 I'll keep you safe
 You keep me strong
 Oh, jump that 43
 Are you wild like me
 Raised by wolves and other beasts
 I tell you all the time
 I'm not mad
 You tell me all the time
 I got plans
 Oh, jump that 43
 Are you wild like me
 Raised by wolves and other beasts

Oh, baby
 Oh, baby
 You're having a bad dream
 Here in my arms
 Oh
 You came to me
 Could all be a bad thing
 Doing harm
 Oh oh oh
 Oh
 You run from me
 We move like a bad scene
 Shot in the dark
 Oh, but please
 Please wake me
 For my love lies patiently
 Please baby, please
 And my love life waits for me
 Oh, love
 You came to me
 Are you having a bad time
 There in your home
 Oh, sugar
 Give into me
 You're just having a bad dream
 Of ringing alarms
 Oh, but please
 Please shake me from my lovesick patient dream
 Please baby, please
 And my love plays wait and see
 Oh, I'm on my knees
 Yeah, I'm on my knees
 I promise I'm clean
 But my love life waits
 You're already gone
 Yeah, you're already gone
 We are already home
 My love life stumbles on
 Oh, baby
 Lean into me
 There's always a side door
 Into the dark

__Title__Red Eyes By The War On Drugs__Title__

Come and see
 Where I witness everything
 On my knees
 To beat it down, to get to my soul
 Against my will
 Anyone can tell it's you coming
 But baby, don't mind
 Leave it on the line, leave it all your own way
 Come and ride away
 It's easier to stick to the earth
 Surrounded by the night
 Surrounded by the night and you don't go home
 But you abuse my faith
 Losing everytime but I don't know where
 You're on my side again
 So ride the key wherever it goes
 I'll be the one, I can't
 You're all I've got to wait
 You're running in the dark when I come to my sense
 Well you can see it through the darkness coming my way
 Well we won't get lost inside again
 Oh no, no season, I can't wait
 Made of iron, made of wood
 I can't hear
 Don't think we would mind against it
 I would keep you here, but I can't
 Oh, I'll talk to you if I can find you now
 I will see you wherever I go babe
 She's on my side again
 The easy way I come to my sense
 Walking in the downtown talks to my soul
 They won't get lost inside again
 On my way
 I can see in the darkness combing my mind
 Well we're here
 Don't get lost inside
 You won't get lost inside at all
 You're on my way, woo!

 Lightless miles

If only there could be another way to do this
 Cause it feels like murder
 To put your heart through this
 I know I always said that I could never hurt you
 Well this is the very very last time I'm ever going to 
 But I know that I'll be happier
 And I know you will too
 Said, I know that I'll be happier
 And I know you will too
 Eventually
 Eventually
 Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
 Cause If I was never in your life
 You wouldn't have to change this
 But I know that I'll be happier
 And I know you will too
 Said, I know that I'll be happier
 And I know you will too
 Eventually
 Eventually
 And I know just what I've got to do
 And it's got to be soon
 Cause I know that I'll be happier

Tell me a line
 Make it easy for me
 Open your arms
 Dance with me until I feel alright
 It's good in the dark
 Good in the dark
 But into the lover's light
 Here comes another fight
 So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
 Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm
 Here it comes, here it comes
 And what you're asking me now
 Disastrous now
 Hoping and hoping, and hoping
 The feeling goes away
 Never change, never change
 Never change, never change
 Never change, never change
 Never change, this is why I fell in love, oh
 Never change, never change
 Never change, never change
 Never change, never change
 Never change, that's just too up there in love with
 Oh, this is the time
 The very best time
 So give me a line and take me home
 Take me over
 But dashing the hopes
 Dashing the hopes
 And smashing the pride
 The morning's got you on the ropes, oh
 And love is a murderer
 Love is a murderer
 But if she calls you tonight
 Everything is alright, yeah, we know
 And love is a curse
 Shout in a hearse
 Love is an open book
 To a of your bad poetry
 And this is coming from me
 But I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
 Turn on the light
 Make it easy for me
 Fill the divide
 Fumble in the kitchen 'til it's right
 What an awful sight
 But there's love in your eyes
 Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
 But maybe that's just your lover finds
 All night
 And I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
 And I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
 And I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
 And I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change, I can change
 I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
 
__Title__Should Have Known Better By Sufjan Stevens__Title__

I should have known better
 To see what I could see
 My black shroud
 Holding down my feelings
 A pillar for my enemies
 I should have wrote a letter
 And grieve what I happen to grieve
 My black shroud
 I never trust my feelings
 I waited for the remedy
 When I was three, three maybe four
 She left us at that video store
 Be my rest, be my fantasy
 I'm light as a feather
 I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
 My black shroud
 Frightened by my feelings
 I only want to be a relief
 No, I'm not a go
 The demon had a spell on me
 My black shroud
 Captain of my feelings
 The only thing I want to believe
 When I was three, and free to explore
 I saw her face on the back of the door
 Be my vest, be my fantasy
 I should have known better
 Nothing can be changed
 The past is still the past
 The bridge to nowhere
 I should've wrote a letter
 Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
 Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
 The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting
 My brother had a daughter
 The beauty that she brings, illumination
 Don't back down, there is nothing left
 The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
 I'm a fool in the fetter
 Rose of Aaron's beard, where you can reach me
 Don't back down
 Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
 My brother had a daughter
 The beauty that she brings, illumination

 Hey man, tricks can't wait to hear my emotions
 Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 People say I'm a one
 But what happens when I have two
 I washed your dishes, but I shitted in your bathroom
 Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 We broke your glasses, but covered our asses
 Take time silently, feel real room hi
 Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 Yeah, every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
 Imagine when
 Every time the sun comes up, I see double

 She keeps you
 On the phone
 She breaks
 On the water
 She sinks into your sofa like a stone
 When victoria falls
 No one knows how low she goes
 When victoria falls
 No one knows how low she goes
 She laughs
 Like she means it
 She sleeps
 Behind closed doors
 She skims
 On the surface
 She pirouettes across your kitchen floor

 How low she goes

 How low she goes
 
__Title__Let It Happen By Tame Impala__Title__

It's always around me, all this noise
 But not really as loud as the voice saying
 Let it happen, let it happen 
 Just let it happen, let it happen
 All this running around
 Trying to cover my shadow
 An ocean growing inside
 All the others seem shallow
 All this running around
 Bearing down on my shoulders
 I can hear an alarm
 Must be morning
 I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
 It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
 And when it happens, when it happens 
 So let it happen, let it happen
 All this running around
 I can't fight it much longer
 Something's trying to get out
 And it's never been closer
 If my ticker fails
 Make up some other story
 And if I never come back
 Tell my mother I'm sorry
 I will not vanish and you will not scare me
 Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
 All the while thinking I might as well do it
 They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid
 Take the next ticket to take the next train
 Why would I do it
 Maybe I was ready all along
 Maybe I was ready all along
 Maybe I was ready all along
 Maybe I was ready all along
 
__Title__Night Shift By Lucy Dacus__Title__

The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
 I mistakenly called them by your name
 I was let down it wasn't the same
 I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind
 Regaining my self
 But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
 Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth
 Call you a bitch and leave
 Why did I come here
 What was the plan
 I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
 But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
 Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
 Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
 Don't hold your breath, forget you've ever saw me at my best
 You don't deserve what you don't respect
 Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
 Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
 Take back what you said
 Can't lose what you never had
 I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
 But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
 Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
 Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
 You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
 And I'll never see you again if I can help it
 In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
 Dedicated to new lovers
 You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
 And I'll never see you again if I can help it
 In five years I hope the songs feel like covers

 And I'll never see you again if I can help it
 In five years I hope the songs feel like covers

 Ooh, it goes hand in hand
 with fear for the afterlife
 Ooh, how can we fight it,
 fight it if we don't even know why
 While the dollar is strong
 While nobody else relies
 When they turn the corner
 When you know we're out of sight
 Dark days in the summer
 In the rain the water's fine
 It was wild combination
 Either that or right down the line
 Ooh, it goes hand in hand
 with fear for the afterlife
 Ooh, how can we fight it,
 fight it if we don't even know why
 I've been on the way, I've been on the way,
 I've been on my way for so long
 I've been on the way, I've been on the way,
 I've been on my way for so long
 
__Title__Lemon Glow By Beach House__Title__

Read my fortune to
 Tell me what you see
 Cross it like a T
 It's all the same to me
 This game I play, I do it every day
 I promise I'll be fine
 Bear it every time
 When you turn the lights down low
 Lemon color, honey glow
 See this state I'm in
 Is crawling in my skin
 Fever's took me back
 And turned me inside out
 When you turn the lights down low
 Lemon color, honey glow
 It's what you do
 This pulls me through
 To the other end
 Where it begins
 You see through me
 Still, it's coming back
 I come alive
 You stay all night
 Feel it coming right through you
 The color of your mind
 The color of your mind
 The color of your mind
 You feel it coming right through you
 You feel it coming right through you
 It's on the other side
 It's doesn't have to be this way
 It's doesn't have to be this way
 The color of your mind
 It's what you do
 This pulls me through
 I come alive
 You stay all night
 It's what you do
 This pulls me through
 I come alive
 You stay all night
 Candy colored mystery
 The color of your mind

Oh she can wait for what I can give
 She knows what I am but she won't believe me
 Is it all ok
 Will I come off the lightest
 I can't believe, it's always like this
 Kept it at bay
 Yes you kept your word
 It's there on your mouth but it's not what I heard
 If I follow the light that I deem the brightest
 I won't believe it, it's always like this
 
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 but I'm not whole
 oh you can wait for what I can give you
 know what I am see know how I live it
 try to look proud but you're not in the slightest
 It's happening now and it's always been like this
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole

 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all
 I'm not whole
 I'm not whole
 oh you waste it all

__Title__Shut Up Kiss Me By Angel Olsen__Title__

I ain't hanging up this time
 I ain't giving up tonight
 Even if you walk around
 As though you think you're right
 At your worst you still believe
 It's worth a fight
 I could make it go away
 Tell me what you think
 And don't delay
 We could still be having some
 Sweet memories
 This heart still beats for you
 Why can't you see
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Stop your crying
 It's alright
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Stop pretending I'm not there
 When it's clear I'm not going anywhere
 If I'm out of sight then take another look around
 I'm still out there hoping to be found
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Stop your crying
 It's alright
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 I could make it all disappear
 You could feed me all of your fears
 We could end all this pain right here
 We could rewind all of those tears
 I could take it down to the floor
 You don't have to feel it anymore
 A love so real that it can't be ignored
 It's all over baby but I'm still young
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight
 Stop your crying
 It's alright
 Shut up kiss me
 Hold me tight

__Title__Necessary Evil By Unknown Mortal Orchestra__Title__

Transform into the animal you need to
 Fly from a destiny infested with chemicals
 You need a new drug not invented by the C
 I wanna be your friend but don't have the self
 We're in love
 But I don't get what you see in me
 Lovin me could be your fatal flaw
 Just hangin in here trying to be your
 Necessary Evil
 Nobody can get a tan in the moonlight
 Come on inside tell me is it just a bit too much
 He drooled on a pillow and looked like an angel
 She hit a blunt but it would not chill her out at all
 We're in love
 But she don't get what I see in her
 Lovin me could be your fatal flaw
 Just hangin in here trying to be your
 Necessary Evil
 Transform into the animal you need to
 Fly from a destiny infested with chemicals
 You need a new drug not invented by the C
 I wanna be your friend but don't have the self
 We're in love
 But I don't get what you see in me
 Lovin me could be your fatal flaw
 Just hangin in here trying to be your
 Necessary Evil
 
__Title__She'S A Witch By Gengahr__Title__

Maybe she'll sink
 Maybe she'll fly
 I caught a witch that cries all the time
 Maybe she'll sink
 Maybe she'll fly
 I caught a witch that cries all the time
 They're coming to get you
 It's a good thing I've been working out
 There's nothing left to hold me back
 I'm not gonna miss you
 But I always wanna kiss you now
 Maybe she'll sink
 Maybe she'll fly
 I caught a witch that cries all the time
 Maybe she'll sink
 Maybe she'll fly
 I caught a witch that cries all the time
 
__Title__Step By Vampire Weekend__Title__

Every time I see you in the world,
 You always step to my girl
 Back, back, way back
 When I used to front like Angkor Wat
 Mechanicsburg, Anchorage, and Dar es Salaam
 While home in New York
 Was champagne and disco
 Tapes from L
 But actually Oakland and not Alameda
 Your girl was in Berkeley with her communist reader
 Mine was entombed within boombox and walkman
 I was a hoarder but girl that was back then
 The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
 What you on about
 I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
 I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
 Such a modest mouse
 I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
 Every time I see you in the world,
 You always step to my girl
 Ancestors told me That their girl was better
 She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
 I just ignored all the tales of a past life
 Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
 And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
 Well they didn't know how to dress for the weather
 I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
 Snow falling slow to the sound of the master
 The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
 What you on about
 I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
 I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
 Such a modest mouse
 I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
 Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
 Age is an honor 
 We saw the stars when they hid from the world
 You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
 Maybe she's gone, and I can't resurrect her
 The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
 We know the true death 
 Everyone's dying, but girl 
 The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
 What you on about
 I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
 I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
 Such a modest mouse
 I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
 The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
 What you on about
 I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
 I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
 Such a modest mouse
 I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
 Every time I see you in the world,
 You always step to my girl
 
__Title__Alaska By Maggie Rogers__Title__

I was walking through icy streams
 That took my breath away
 Moving slowly through westward water
 Over glacial plains
 
 And I walked off you
 And I walked off an old me
 Oh me oh my I thought it was a dream
 So it seemed
 
 And now, breathe deep
 I'm inhaling
 You and I, there's air in between
 Leave me be
 I'm exhaling
 You and I, there's air in between
 You and I, there's air in between
 
 Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
 Without thinking of you
 Learned to talk and say
 Whatever I wanted to
 
 And I walked off you
 And I walked off an old me
 Oh me oh my
 I thought it was a dream
 So it seemed
 
 And now, breathe deep
 I'm inhaling
 You and I, there's air in between
 Leave me be
 I'm exhaling
 You and I, there's air in between
 
 You and I, there's air in between
 You and I, there's air in between
 
__Title__No Reptiles By Everything Everything__Title__

Slip from the trees
 To the dirt to the menace
 To the wild to the car
 Under snow, cut to ribbons
 Like a coral to your shin
 Like a manacle to swing
 Fresh from the breast
 Now a river running fat
 To the manor born a rat
 To the manor born a flea
 To a flood to a drain
 Now a rubber, now a chain
 I was in the war
 You were in the war
 Plump from the sugar
 With the city at your back
 To the cannon with a match
 From a milk into a mass grave
 Never mind that, I can take that
 Bones in a bowl
 Like a toad
 Take the shape of the mould
 Like a mummy on a pole
 And a merry little head
 Bob around when you're dead
 I was on my knees
 You were on your knees
 And no reptiles!
 Just soft boiled eggs in shirts and ties
 Waiting for the flashing green man
 Quivering and wobbling just like all the eggs you know
 I'm going to kill a stranger
 So don't you be a stranger
 Oh baby, it's alright
 It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
 Old enough to run
 Old enough to fire a gun
 Oh baby, it's alright
 It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
 Old enough to run
 Old enough to fire a gun
 Oh baby, it's alright
 It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
 Old enough to run
 Old enough to fire a gun
 Oh baby, it's alright
 It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
 Old enough to run
 Old enough to fire a gun
 Just give me this one night
 Just one night to feel
 Like I might be on the right path
 The path that takes me home
 Wise enough to know myself
 Just give me this one night
 Just one night to feel
 Like I might be on the right path
 Old enough to fire a gun
 Just give me this one night
 Just one night to feel
 Like I might be on the right path
 The path that takes me home
 Wise enough to know myself
 Just give me this one night
 Just one night to feel
